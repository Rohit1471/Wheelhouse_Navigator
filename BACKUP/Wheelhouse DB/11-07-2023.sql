To address such issues, we are further strengthening our authentication systems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Authentication is a critical system and any improvements must be done in a careful manner. We have reviewed various plugins and best practices in our ecosystem to come up with our solution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In light of the current public discourse, we are expediting the update of our plugin. We will initiate a rollout by EOD.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>MalCare reports that its users have seen no evidence of the vulnerability being exploited.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Snicco noted that the same vulnerability also exists in WPRemote (20k installs) and Blogvault (100k installs) plugins, as they share the same code. Users of either of these plugins or the MalCare plugin should update to the latest versions as soon as possible now that the vulnerability advisory and proof of concept have been published.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 11 Jul 2023 03:28:31 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:54:\"Do The Woo Community: Bring Your Podcast to Do the Woo\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=75527\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"https://dothewoo.io/bring-your-podcast-to-do-the-woo/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:367:\"<p>If you have an existing WordPress focused podcast, consider introducing it to our audience at Do the Woo.</p>\n<p>&gt;&gt; The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dothewoo.io/bring-your-podcast-to-do-the-woo/\">Bring Your Podcast to Do the Woo</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dothewoo.io\">Do the Woo - a WooCommerce Builder Community</a>	.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 10 Jul 2023 08:13:48 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"WordCamp Central: WordCamp Dhaka 2023 Has Been Cancelled\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:39:\"https://central.wordcamp.org/?p=3166653\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"https://central.wordcamp.org/news/2023/07/wordcamp-dhaka-2023-has-been-cancelled/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1270:\"<p>WordCamp Dhaka 2023 has been cancelled and the official announcement has been published on <a href=\"https://dhaka.wordcamp.org/2023/\">the event website</a>.

WordPress 6.3 is set to be the final major release of Phase 2, which focused on Customization. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Phase 3 will shift focus from the editors and move into other parts of the admin in an effort to bring seamless collaboration to WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The primary aim of real-time collaboration is to build functionality into the&nbsp;block&nbsp;editors so that concurrent collaboration, shared edits, and online presence of peers are possible,&#8221; Ventura said. &#8220;Supporting these workflows is not just about concurrency, though, but also about lifting restrictions that have been present in WordPress for a long time, such as locking a post when two people try to edit at the same time.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The technical challenges here are in making this available to all WordPress users, even those on the most economical hosting environments. Ventura shared a quick preview of what that might look like, along with the scope of the tasks that would be part of this effort.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>In the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/07/04/workflows/\">Workflows</a> document, Ventura details collaborative features that will be part of this phase, including allowing users to add comments, suggest edits, and tag other users for peer review. These enhancements would apply to both content creation and design changes on block themes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are some interesting projects listed within the scope of this section, including a publishing checklist, sharing draft links with permission controls, and exploring hook points for&nbsp;version control&nbsp;systems to take over internal revision systems if desired.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />image credit: <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/07/04/workflows/\">Workflows</a> &#8211; Matías Ventura\n\n\n\n<p>Users can expect that <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/07/05/revisions/\">Revisions</a> will also be getting some major improvements as part of the Collaboration phase of the project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;As part of improving the overall experience, we should also go beyond document level history and explore how the interface could let users browse through single block changes and offer the ability to restore them individually rather than requiring full post restores,&#8221; Ventura said. &#8220;For global styles, we should evolve the revisions panel to allow comparing two revisions side by side. For synced patterns, we could allow browsing edit history with side by side and overlay comparison tools.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Long-awaited improvements to WordPress&#8217; <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/07/07/media-library/\">Media Library</a> are also considered part of this phase.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The main goals are to expand the media management capabilities, unify the block edit and single media interfaces, and improve upon the major media flows,&#8221; Ventura said. He highlighted a few major areas that may get some enhancements, such as categorization and tagging, better handling of attached media, and design improvements to the library view.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other Media Library projects may include a revamp of the image editing interface, which remains somewhat unintuitive at this time. Ventura proposes these tools, such as cropping and thumbnail browsing, be updated to align more with the current block editor tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contributors may also be exploring contribution to the commons from WordPress, along with improvements to attribution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;As we look into expanding the presence and touch points of <a href=\"https://openverse.org/\">Openverse</a>, it’d be interesting to see how contributions to the commons could work directly from a user’s WordPress install,&#8221; Ventura said. &#8220;Another area to look at is improving handling and presentation of other media types (audio, video, files) and their connection with blocks and the block APIs. We should resurface work on a native Playlist block, ideally powered by the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/03/30/proposal-the-interactivity-api-a-better-developer-experience-in-building-interactive-blocks/\">Interactivity API</a>.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reactions to the outlined vision and scope for the Collaboration phase have so far been positive, as users and contributors are eager to see a strong focus come to some of the other parts of WordPress that have not had much attention for years. The newer real-time collaboration features that will take WordPress beyond the days of locking posts while another person is editing, have the potential to speed up content creation and editing for groups working on the same website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Very much looking forward to this phase. I think it will really enable larger teams to work on posts much easier,&#8221; WordPress developer Rich Holman <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/07/03/real-time-collaboration/#comment-45051\">commented</a>. &#8220;I’ve mentioned this before but the ability to continue working on a published draft without the front-end updating seems important especially with more editors working on something, especially if doing more experimental edits.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more details on the features being considered for this phase, check out the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/03/24/phase-3-collaboration/\">Phase 3 overview post</a>, along with Ventura&#8217;s more recent write-ups on how contributors will improve and expand WordPress&#8217; collaboration architecture with updates to <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/07/03/real-time-collaboration/\">Real-Time Collaboration</a>, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/07/04/workflows/\">Workflows</a>, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/07/05/revisions/\">Revisions</a>, and the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/07/07/media-library/\">Media Library</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 07 Jul 2023 19:40:58 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:45:\"WordCamp Central: WordCamp Rochester is Back!\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:39:\"https://central.wordcamp.org/?p=3166570\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"https://central.wordcamp.org/news/2023/07/wordcamp-rochester-is-back/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1772:\"<a href=\"https://central.wordcamp.org/files/2023/07/cropped-14120055196ucu6-scaled-1-1.jpg\"><img /></a>\n\n\n\n<p>On Saturday, September 30, 2023, Rochester will again (for the sixth time) host the region’s WordCamp for bloggers and web designers of all skill levels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Registration opens at 8:00am.

It&#8217;s the kind of simple theme that enables you to quickly get started writing online, without having to configure a bunch of design elements. The homepage features a profile image (Site Logo), site title, and recent posts with dates.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Single posts display with the feature image at the top of the post, although this template can easily be edited if this is an undesirable feature. Previous and Next post navigation appears under the post. Users can add menu items to display at the top, but clicking the site logo brings the visitor back home in the absence of a navigation menu.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>The Hey theme comes in two different styles &#8211; the default and a serif variation. Colors can be adjusted to create a more vibrant palette for the site design.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>One major drawback to this theme, which may not be immediately evident by looking at the demo, is that if users want to display more than the three most recent posts, they will need to add the pagination block inside the query loop block. It will also need to be styled to match the theme better. The query loop can be edited to show more posts on the homepage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although Hey is a simple personal blog theme, it also comes packaged with templates for WooCommerce compatibility. This is likely for the benefit of WordPress.com users who may want to quickly fire up a store. Self-hosted users who want to sell products with WooCommerce will be able to easily display things like the mini-cart, customer account block, product archive, product search results, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, Hey is an elegantly simple block theme with a clean design and plentiful white space. It&#8217;s suitable for the person who wants an almost blank slate to get started, or just a theme that enables writing without any distraction for the reader.

WordPress&#8217; <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/requirements/\">minimum supported version</a> has sat at PHP 5.6.20 since 2019, but will be updated to 7.0.0 in the next release. The recommended PHP version will stay the same at 7.4+.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The minimum supported version was last adjusted in WordPress 5.2 in 2019, and since then usage of PHP 5.6 has dropped to 3.9% of monitored WordPress installations <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/stats/\" target=\"_blank\">as of July 2023</a>,&#8221; WordPress core developer John Blackbourn said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;There’s no concrete usage percentage that a PHP version must fall below before support in WordPress is dropped, but historically the project maintainers have used 5% as the baseline. Now that usage of PHP 5.6 is well below that at 3.9% and dropping by around 0.1% every few weeks, plans to increase the minimum supported PHP version can move forward.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blackbourn also emphasized that WordPress&#8217; support for PHP 8.0, 8.1, and 8.2 is &#8220;very good&#8221; and contributors may soon act on <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/06/20/proposal-criteria-for-removing-beta-support-from-each-php-8-version/\">a proposal for the criteria that would enable them to remove the &#8220;beta&#8221; support label</a> on new PHP versions. Nearly 26% of WordPress users are already running sites on PHP 8.0+. </p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Prior to this minimum required version boost, some hosts had even taken matters into their own hands in urging users to get on newer versions of PHP. Dreamhost <a href=\"https://twitter.com/idavinder/status/1673948104591122432\">charges additional fees</a> for sites that require <a href=\"https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360004672631-PHP-extended-support\">extended support</a> for PHP 7.4 and older. <a href=\"https://www.ionos.com/help/hosting/troubleshooting-for-php/php-extended-support/\">IONOS</a> and <a href=\"https://www.strato-hosting.co.uk/faq/hosting/what-is-strato-php-extended-support/\">Strato</a> have similar policies. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The decision to bump the minimum supported version is happening after a lengthy seven-month long <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/57345\">discussion</a>, which surprisingly <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/57345#comment:93\">drew a little resistance</a>. Although sites that remain on PHP 5.6 cannot upgrade beyond WordPress 6.2, they will still receive security updates, as the project currently <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/security/2022/09/07/dropping-security-updates-for-wordpress-versions-3-7-through-4-0/\">backports them to versions 4.1+</a>. The bump to 7.0.0 for the minimum supported version will have many benefits for the WordPress ecosystem of themes and plugins, will significantly reduce memory usage for upgraded websites, and provide better security and improvements to core tooling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;There are no plans to bump the minimum supported PHP version on a schedule,&#8221; Blackbourn said. &#8220;The core team will continue to monitor usage of PHP versions and work with the hosting team to encourage users and hosting companies to upgrade their versions of PHP as swiftly as possible. The 5% usage baseline will continue to be used for the foreseeable future.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 05 Jul 2023 21:30:40 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:13;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:84:\"WPTavern: WordPress 6.3 Beta 3 Released, Introduces UI Changes to Pattern Management\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=146527\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:94:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-6-3-beta-3-released-introduces-ui-changes-to-pattern-management\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3172:\"<p>WordPress contributors are onto another round of testing, as <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2023/07/wordpress-6-3-beta-3/\">6.3 Beta 3 was released</a> this week. RC 1 is expected on July 18, and a live product demo is anticipated to be broadcast on Thursday, July 20, 2023 at 16:00 UTC. These demos have become a more regular part of the release process and allow viewers to familiarize themselves with important new features and updates coming in the release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beta 3 includes approximately 34 updates to the Site Editor since the previous beta release, and more than 40 updates coming from Trac.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A last-minute PR has <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/52102\">renamed Library to Patterns</a> in the Site Editor and was cherry-picked to get it included in Beta 3. Automattic-sponsored Gutenberg contributor Aaron Robertshaw cited three reasons for the renaming:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Discovery: this is an opportunity to make patterns front and center as we are introducing the ability to save custom patterns. They should be front and center in the &#8220;Design&#8221; tab.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Clarity: library can be obscure and overlaps with other terminology (like Media Library). We didn&#8217;t get to add font library management in this round, but it would have made things more confusing (would a user expect to see their font library under &#8220;Styles&#8221; or an item called &#8220;Library&#8221;?). Calling it patterns removes that ambiguity.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Presence: patterns is a unique name that has been established in the WP branding parlance for a bit and deserves more clear placement.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This video from the PR gives a quick overview of the changes testers should see in the Patterns UI as of Beta 3:</p>\n\n\n\nGutenberg PR: Patterns: Rename Library to Patterns <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/52102\">#52102</a>\n\n\n\n<p>Beta 3 <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/51990\">introduces a new lock icon</a> to designate theme patterns as unable to be edited or modified. It also adds a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/51954\">sync status details section</a> within the pattern sidebar navigation screen. </p>\n\n\n\n<img />image credit: <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/51990\">Gutenberg PR #51990</a>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a significant number of new things being introduced after Beta 1, which seems usual. Major features like the pattern creation and the Patterns section made their debut in <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-16-1-introduces-pattern-creation-and-library-adds-distraction-free-mode-to-site-editor\">Gutenberg 16.1</a> but had very little testing before being rolled into the upcoming WordPress 6.3 release.

My name is Nathan Wrigley. Jukebox is a podcastwhich is dedicated to all things WordPress. The people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case, how and why you need to be thinking sustainably when building websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast player of choice. Or by going to WPTavern.com forward slash feed forward slash podcast. And you can copy that URL into most podcast players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature on the podcast, I&#8217;m keen to hear from you, and hopefully get you, or your idea featured on the show. Head to WPTavern.com forward slash contact forward slash jukebox, and use the form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today, we have Louise Towler. She joined me at the recent WordCamp Europe in Athens to talk about websites and making them more sustainable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Louise is the founder of Indigo Tree, a UK based agency with deep expertise in WordPress websites. She gave a presentation at WordCamp Europe entitled, Digital sustainability: The benefits for business and the environment, in which she emphasized the impact websites can have on our planet. Her aim was to deliver practical tips for users and developers to help them make informed decisions. This presentation is the focus of today&#8217;s podcast, and we cover quite a lot of ground.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Louise highlights the significant role which electricity plays in powering data centers and transmitting data to end devices. Even if data centers use renewable energy, there is still a need to address overall electricity consumption. She points out that the internet is the fourth largest polluter globally, surpassing the airline industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We discussed how the continuous and widespread use of the internet has made it difficult to reduce its own impact, while still emphasizing the importance of the steps that we can take to make the internet more energy efficient.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She suggests ways that we can all make a difference right away. Educating clients about the consequences of certain design choices, such as using large videos or auto-play features that require substantial data to load. Optimizing videos, images, and other website elements, which makes it possible to reduce data consumption and improve performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The conversation then explores other suggestions, such as using modern image formats, using images as placeholders for videos, self hosted fonts, and considering the carbon footprint of email communications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Louise acknowledges the challenges of discussing environmental concerns with clients, whilst also explaining that we have to come up with ways to make clients understand that these decisions are beneficial to them as well. After all, an optimized website is one that is looked upon favorably by search engines. Whilst clients ultimately are the decision makers, informing them about the consequences of their choices can help them be more informed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moving onto WordPress, we talk about the responsibility theme authors play. It&#8217;s a crucial role, helping users make sustainable choices. Her agency builds custom themes for clients which allows them to have full control over design decisions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We get into the subject of how legislation is certainly coming, and so getting in early and understanding the implications of such legislation will help your endeavors in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Towards the end of the podcast, we chat about some of the tools which you can use to assess the impact that your websites have, including a tool which Louise and her team have been working on for the last few years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in how your sites can become more sustainable, this podcast is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to find out more, you can find all of the links in the show notes by heading to WPTavern.com forward slash podcast, where you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so without further delay, I bring you Louise Towler.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast today by Louise Towler. Hi Louise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:54] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> Thank you for inviting me. Hello.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:56] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> We&#8217;re going to talk today about, well possibly the most important topic ever, which is the environment and your website compared to the environment. Prior to that Louise, will you just tell us a little bit about you, so that we have some context. Who are you? What&#8217;s your relationship with WordPress and so on?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:13] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> Okay. I am the founder of Indigo Tree. We&#8217;re a small but beautiful WordPress agency based about 30 minutes on the train north of London in the UK. There&#8217;s 15 of us in total at the moment. We have an engineering team, a project management team, and a support team, and we build WordPress websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I started building websites, well my first webpage that I built was built Christmas Day, the year 2000, because my husband was daft enough to buy me a book on html. So he cooked the turkey and I built myself a little webpage. I started freelancing about 20 years ago, and then one of my freelancing clients said to me, we&#8217;ve heard there&#8217;s this thing called WordPress. Would you mind building our website in WordPress? And I was like, okay, I&#8217;ll give it a go. And went off and Googled and found out how to do it, and the rest is history.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:09] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Nice. You did a talk today entitled The Benefits for Business and the Environment. Just give us a bit of a background about your thoughts on the environment. What I mean by that, is this something that you are concerned about in your normal life? Does the environment figure heavily in your daily life?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:27] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> It does. It&#8217;s really difficult to tread lightly on the planet. It&#8217;s very hard to do things in a sustainable way, but I think I&#8217;m very conscious of it. So I buy a few clothes, but I wear them a lot rather than throw them away, and the fast fashion thing. I use recycled paper. I try to do things in a good way. Turn off lights. Think about my travel. But it is genuinely hard. But then I have children and they&#8217;re going to live a lot longer than me, and global warming is going to affect them a lot more than it&#8217;s going to affect me. But 2050 is not that far away. And we are in trouble, as we can see by the mad world weather that&#8217;s happening at the moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:16] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You work in the website building industry, as do I. Which feels in my daily interaction with my computer, it feels like the cleanest thing ever. I have a shiny laptop. I have a shiny phone. None of them put smoke out of the back when I switched them on. You know, if I worked in the automotive industry, it would be obvious what my footprint was. But I switch on my computer, there&#8217;s no connection between that and the environment. And yet it&#8217;s pretty bad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:49] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:50] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> We browse the internet. We&#8217;re probably asking Google and all the other rivals, trivial things all the time. So make the connection for us. What is the environmental impact? What are the things which are happening between me switching on my computer and browsing WordPress websites? What are the things that are going on? What&#8217;s the technology, the bits and pieces that we need to be thinking about?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:13] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> Well, if the internet was a country, it would be the fourth largest polluter. Compared to airlines, you know, that are 1.6%, it&#8217;s massive. It is just massive. And it&#8217;s fundamentally about electricity. Because it&#8217;s electricity that powers the data centers, whether or not they&#8217;re running on renewable energy, the fact is they still need electricity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;ve got the transmission, the wires between the data centers and the end devices, and then you&#8217;ve got the power to power your device. If you&#8217;re on a phone, you are recharging it. If you&#8217;re on a laptop, you are plugging it in, and that&#8217;s all using electricity. And not all of that electricity is renewable and the electricity that comes through the wires, you don&#8217;t have any control about what proportion of that is renewable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On a hot, windy day in the UK, a vast proportion of that electricity is from renewable energy, from solar and wind turbines. But on a dark, gloomy day with no wind, a massive proportion of that is fossil fuel powered electricity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:27] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It feels like we&#8217;re completely addicted to the internet. I use the car that I have, a bit. But I use the internet more or less continually. You know, I&#8217;ve got my phone, it&#8217;s constantly charged up. The merest thought in my head can easily lead me to whip out the phone, do some banal scrolling of Facebook or whatever it may be. And that feels like that&#8217;s crept up on us. We&#8217;re all using it all the time. You said what was it, 4%?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:57] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> It&#8217;s the fourth largest polluter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:59] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Fourth largest polluter. Can you compare that to another industry? You mentioned airlines. Does the internet as a whole, so every website, all the online services that we can use and so on, does that pollute more than the airline industry? Because the airline industry is the poster child of pollution, isn&#8217;t it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:15] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> I believe it does. I mean, the problem is finding out, and even measuring it is really hard. So all the estimates are that it is just massive, and it&#8217;s getting worse. With AI, the stat that I&#8217;ve read is that to do a search in ChatGPT takes four times as much energy as to do a search in Google. And to build that AI model takes a massive amount of processing power to suck in all the data and build out that model that then does predict the next word that&#8217;s going to come out in the chat box.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so it&#8217;s not getting better. When you are talking about carbon footprints and getting to net zero, you&#8217;ve not just got to change the energy mix so that you&#8217;re running off renewable energy. You need to actually reduce demand. In the UK there&#8217;s a carbon reduction in task force. Their target is by 2030, they will have reduced demand by 15% for electricity in comparison to 2021. You have to reduce the demand as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:25] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:26] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> And the connection to IT and websites is that if you transmit less data, you are, there&#8217;s not a direct correlation always, but you are essentially using less electricity to transmit that data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:37] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So the easiest way to mitigate your use of the internet is just to stop using it. But that&#8217;s completely unrealistic now?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:44] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> Well, a company with zero carbon footprint is probably a company that&#8217;s not in business. You can&#8217;t not use the internet. What you have to do, we have to try and make sure the internet uses less electricity to do what it does.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:59] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay, so given that we&#8217;re not going to be switching our computers off, we&#8217;re not going back to the internet stone age, if you like. We&#8217;ve got to figure out ways to reduce the amount of carbon that we put out. So we&#8217;ve got to become responsible citizens because we&#8217;re using the internet. But also, we&#8217;re in a slightly unique position, you, I, and the people listening to this podcast, because we&#8217;re sitting behind the websites that are causing the pollution. And that&#8217;s, I guess, where the rest of this conversation is going to go. What are the things that we can do to make our websites for our clients, for ourselves, pollute a little bit less?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:38] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> Think about the data and educate your client. So in the first instance, if your client wants that amazing stock video on the banner of their homepage, that auto plays in the background and looks absolutely fab. But actually the amount of data that you are then having to load on the homepage to deliver that video is massive. Well explain to them the consequences of that decision.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;ll probably mean the homepage is a little bit slower, which won&#8217;t be as good for Core Web Vitals and for search. So whether or not they care about the planet, they should be caring about the performance of their website. And the fact is it will use more data and that&#8217;s not good for people or the planet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I&#8217;m on a fixed price data plan, because I&#8217;m on a low income and my children&#8217;s school has a massive video on the homepage of their school website with lots of happy kids running around the playground. And every time I visit that website, I&#8217;m using up my scarce resources of data, auto playing that video, that&#8217;s not very respectful to me when I&#8217;m trying to go about my daily life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there&#8217;s lots of levels you can talk to your clients about why it&#8217;s good to do things. So it&#8217;s things like optimizing videos, optimizing images. If you&#8217;re familiar with Core Web Vitals and trying to speed up websites, these are nothing new. But you know, design your website with two fonts rather than five.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Think about when you embed videos on the page. The block editor, it&#8217;s really easy to embed a video from YouTube or Vimeo, but use a plugin and put a facade in front of it so that when you actually load the page it loads an image. If it&#8217;s below the fold, you can lazy load the image. If people don&#8217;t scroll down, the image doesn&#8217;t load, and it&#8217;s only when they click on that image that the video plays and actually downloads that extra data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you are being really respectful to your visitors as well as to the planet by consciously thinking about these things. And it doesn&#8217;t cost anymore if you plan it in from the beginning. Talking to your clients and planning it, most clients are really happy to have that conversation because in the end, performance and speed should increase conversions and profit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:56] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Actually, that&#8217;s a really good point. You mentioned, just as we were beginning, that you run an agency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:00] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:01] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Do you have this conversation with your clients?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:03] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> I talk about performance and speed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:08] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, so how does that go down?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:09] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> Fine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:10] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Have you ever had somebody push back and say, no, we need the video? Or is it generally a conversation of look, okay you could have the video, but here&#8217;s the reason why I think for the planet, you shouldn&#8217;t have the video. How does that conversation normally go?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:19] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> We advise them. It&#8217;s like with banners, with sliders, we advise them. I emailed something to a client last week saying, here&#8217;s the Google stats. About 8% will see banner number two. Do you really think banner number three, as one of your key important messages being viewed by 4% of your home paved visitors, you&#8217;re better off putting that content on the page. It is the client&#8217;s choice in the end, but I will educate them so they&#8217;re conscious of the choice that they&#8217;re making. Rather than not aware and then complain that nobody clicks through from banner number three. And I&#8217;m like, well, we did tell you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there&#8217;s some things I don&#8217;t give clients a choice on, like accessibility. They don&#8217;t get a choice about having an accessible website because you don&#8217;t want to give people a choice where you don&#8217;t want them to make a poor decision.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:04] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> And in terms of your agency, do you advertise your environmental credentials?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:09] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> We don&#8217;t really talk about it at the moment, but we will be dipping our toe in the water and talking more and more about it over the next few months, because we&#8217;ve been doing some interesting stuff in the background.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:20] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You mentioned that an autoplay video, that seems like the most extreme example. You know, you go to a website, suddenly you&#8217;ve downloaded without your realizing it, I don&#8217;t know, 10 megabytes of data that you really didn&#8217;t need. Just run through the components of a typical webpage. So what have we got? We&#8217;ve got text, we&#8217;ve got images, we&#8217;ve got video, we&#8217;ve got, audio like this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What are quick wins? What&#8217;s the order, if you like, that you should go through when in your head you&#8217;re trying to make a page more environmentally friendly?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:49] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> I would start with images because a website typically has more images than videos. And if you&#8217;re doing something with images like you are, I don&#8217;t know, using a CDN, or you&#8217;ve installed the performance plugin and you are delivering things as WebP, then one plugin and one solution might work across all images on your website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I would definitely think about images in terms of making sure you deliver the right sized image for the device as well. So make sure that in your theme, you&#8217;ve got that function which saves it all out at the various different break points.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:22] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> If you&#8217;re on a, mobile website, the image that&#8217;s loaded should be the same size as the device that you&#8217;re looking at. Not a great big image that&#8217;s been squished down, okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:30] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> Exactly. And that can be a bit tricky because sometimes on mobile sites for example, we&#8217;ll have a nice banner image, but we&#8217;ll make it cropped and square. Whereas on a desktop site you might have it that letter box shape. And actually it won&#8217;t really work on a mobile. It&#8217;s too sort of narrow and thin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you sometimes need to be a bit careful about, especially with the block editor, do you need to have different versions of images unless the cropping is right in the middle. Doesn&#8217;t work very well with the block editor to just auto crop. It&#8217;s about thinking about it. So I definitely start with images.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Little things like making sure you are using SVGs where it&#8217;s appropriate. If you&#8217;ve got an animated gif, turn it into a video. I then look at the videos. Just make sure you&#8217;ve got facades or posters on videos and try and persuade your client not to have that large banner video.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would then look at fonts and make sure all your fonts are self-hosted. Which is a good thing anyway because certainly from a GDPR perspective, if you are using Google fonts in Europe, then there&#8217;s been some case law around, it&#8217;s leaking data to Google about who&#8217;s using those fonts and you don&#8217;t want to be doing that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that again will speed it up because you can cache the fonts and things like that. And subset the fonts. So I think you can do things where if you are only, if you&#8217;ve got a font set that&#8217;s in multiple languages, but actually your website&#8217;s just in English, only use the bit of the font that you need for the language that you are working in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then I would definitely think about things, other things on the website, like email. If you&#8217;ve got a transactional site and you are sending out lots of confirmation of shipping emails. Do you need a really big logo in the email? Can it be a tiny logo or even just text on a colored background and make those emails have a lower carbon footprint as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:18] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> How does WordPress out of the box do with helping you get to some of these targets?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:26] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> It&#8217;s not helpful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:28] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So I was going to say, I imagine that most people listening to this podcast have an understanding of everything that you just said, but the typical user of WordPress is not somebody that&#8217;s listening this podcast. Used by millions of people who probably see the media library throwing the biggest image they&#8217;ve got, and that&#8217;s it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:43] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> I think you&#8217;ve got to be a responsible theme author. As an agency, we build our own custom themes for each client. So we&#8217;re not constrained in any way at the design stage. But if you&#8217;re choosing either a free theme or a paid for theme, you can be quite wise about it. So if you are you&#8217;re building a brochure site for a client, you don&#8217;t need to choose a theme with every possible e-commerce, form plugin, event plugin, all that extra code. If you&#8217;re not using font awesome icons, then don&#8217;t let the theme pull in the complete font awesome icon set.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just download a little SVG. So try and think about the theme that you choose. It can be a bit of a pain to actually turn off on some of those very flexible all singing, all dancing dancing themes, the options when you just want something really simple.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are some plugins that can help. So for example, we often use a plugin called Perf Matters, which is really good for performance. And one of the things I particularly like about that plugin is, so if we are working with a client where they might have an inquiry form or a landing page with an inquiry form on it. You install a plugin, we use Gravity Forms. Really brilliant plugin. Love it. But of course you get that plugin code in the head of every page, just in case the form&#8217;s required. Well turn it off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can use Perf Matters and go in, and go I only want the Gravity Form code to be embedded on these three pages, on the site that have forms on. Doesn&#8217;t need to be downloaded for any other pages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The same with something like Google Maps, the API for Google Maps. Often you&#8217;ll put it in so that you can have a nice map on your contact page. Well actually, number one, could you replace that map with an image, and then just link out to Google Maps? How many people are actually going to be scrolling in and out on the page?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Think about it from the user&#8217;s perspective, but then actually just have that Google Maps API code in the contact page. Don&#8217;t have it anywhere else on your website. It&#8217;s just not needed. But you see it a lot where all the plugins inject all their stuff into the head on every single page just in case. So go through and turn things off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:02] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You mentioned earlier that obviously this is something you&#8217;re trying to embed in your company. You also mentioned that you don&#8217;t have the conversation about accessibility. It&#8217;s just the way it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:10] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> Well, we talk about it. The only time we really push back is where clients have got brand colors, which aren&#8217;t AA accessible, and then we discuss with them whether we can change them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:21] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> But are you going to in the future be having more conversations like this?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:26] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:27] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong>And if so, how forceful are you going to be with your clients if they push back? Say, no, no, no, no. There&#8217;s a delicate line here, isn&#8217;t there? You want to do the best for your client and the best for your client may be a bitter pill for them to swallow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:39] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> There may be a really good a brand reason, depending on the client, as to why they have to use a particular font. But I would be going to the client and saying, I&#8217;m going to tell you why it&#8217;s not a good idea. In the end, it is your choice. It is your website. You own the site once you&#8217;ve paid me for us to build it. So it is yours to do what you want with. But do it consciously, knowing the consequences of the decision that you are making.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I will always tell them, in the end it is their choice. But with things like brand and fonts and that, well you know, the consequences of pulling in an Adobe font is 6 to 800 milliseconds of a page load. That can be the difference between a first and second spot on google.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So sometimes you can argue it really strongly from a commercial reason, and they will listen and go, right, let&#8217;s go back to our brand designer and get them to find some web fonts or some Google fonts that we can use. And elsewhere, yes, you&#8217;ll use that fancy type kit or whatever font, but let&#8217;s use something for the web that actually will work and not impact on the performance of the site. Because if they&#8217;re a commercial client, they&#8217;re going to care about the performance. We need to make them look good to their boss.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:59] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Given exactly what you just said, is there some accreditation that websites can expose to the world to say, we made an effort here? I&#8217;m trying to think of an example, but there are badges that you can get in all manner of industries to say, okay, we went through this training. We made the effort here, and so we have a badge to prove that we made an effort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is there something that people can do on the internet to say, look, our website is consuming 50%, 30%, whatever, less energy than it might have done. We made an effort. Here&#8217;s our badge to prove it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:32] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> I&#8217;m not aware of a badge, but there are lots of people doing lots of things out there. So there might be. I think it&#8217;s really hard because what might be a good score for a e-commerce site, might be of a poor score for a different type of site. And I think that in the end, yes, you can measure against other people, but actually you have to have that intrinsic motivation for just wanting to do it. It&#8217;s not about collecting badges.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Does it matter if your site is AA accessible and you have a badge on your site? Or does it matter that you basically have enabled 40% of the population with disabilities or temporary impairments to actually access your goods and services, and you&#8217;ll increase your profits as a result?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:15] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So that was the website piece. You know, can you expose this credential to visitors? What about you as an agency? Can you expose your credentials to your clients? Is there anything there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:26] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> Well, we&#8217;re working, and it is a very much a work in progress, towards something called B Corp, which is an accreditation thing that you can get for being, if you like, a good citizen to the planet. It covers environmental. It also covers governance, and more things to help with inclusivity and diversity. And we are rewriting our staff handbook, and we&#8217;re measuring our carbon footprint as part of that, as an agency. But we&#8217;re also doing other things as well. Making sure that we do things in a way that&#8217;s consciously responsible, and there&#8217;s got to be a business for good. We want to be a good citizen for the planet. And I think that&#8217;s quite a high standard. And there&#8217;s, I think about a thousand companies in the UK who have that. And we are not there yet, but it&#8217;s something that I think we can aspire to be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:12] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Do you have any sense that this message that you are preaching here is beginning to catch on? You are definitely in the vanguard. Most people are not talking about this. If we go downstairs, we&#8217;re not really picking up on that message yet. But do you sense some kind of change? Are you communicating with people on a more regular basis about this? Clearly you are interested in it, but are you talking into the void or are people beginning to listen?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:37] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> There&#8217;s a lot of people in communities where the communities are talking about this a lot. I think what&#8217;s really nice is I was given the opportunity to speak at a conference, and this conference, to the entire WebPress community had a session about digital sustainability. I personally think that every conference that anyone puts on should have at least one speaker, or channel, or workshop, or something talking about sustainability in the industry, or sector that the conference is in. Because it is looming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The legislation is coming. The governments are legislating now, and at the moment in the UK it&#8217;s only very, very large businesses who have to do reporting. But if you are a large business wanting a government contract with a value of more than 5 million pounds, which you know, even small consultants and agencies can go for big contracts. You have to have your scope one, scope two, and some scope three emissions and a carbon reduction plan will be coming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By 2028 The National Health Service in the UK will require every product or service that is supplied to it to have a carbon footprint. So you need to be starting now because for some things that&#8217;s going to be really hard to do and it&#8217;s going to take a while to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So start now with the little things, the quick wins. Start measuring where you are, because your carbon reduction plan has to say how you&#8217;re going to reduce. And then you have to show that you are making those reductions. So start measuring now, so that all the things you start doing now can be part of that reduction that you make and you can report on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:18] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So you are describing things in the UK. In the UK in the future, you are literally going to be unable to get certain types of website client work if you cannot prove that you&#8217;ve done the due diligence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:31] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:31] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay, that&#8217;s really interesting. But still a way off. We&#8217;re still five years out from that portcullis closing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:37] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> Yeah. But if you are a large business, very large business, you already have to do mandatory reporting. The government is slowly going to bring that down. It wouldn&#8217;t surprise me in the slightest if by 2030, as well as putting in my annual tax return, on my submission of my company accounts to Companies House, I have to do a carbon accounting report. Every small business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The EU, 23 million organizations there are in the EU at the moment, by 2028, all of them are going to be expected to put in some sort of carbon report on what they&#8217;re doing. The legislation is coming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But even quicker than that, procurement is starting to change. So I think it was the back end of 2021, Tesco sent out a letter to all of their suppliers saying, we want you to do these four things. You need to have a carbon reduction plan. You need to move to green energy. Otherwise you can&#8217;t be part of a supplier to Tesco. Doesn&#8217;t matter whether or not you are a large business or a small business, they sent it out as part of their procurement. So the government legislation is coming, but larger businesses are doing it quicker because they&#8217;re using procurement as a tool to do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then on top of that, for some organizations now it&#8217;s affecting their access to finance. So if I&#8217;m a pension fund or I want to invest in a large enterprise or a business, why would I invest in you, if you are not sustainable in 5, 10, 15 years time? They are now beginning to ask for those carbon reduction plans, sustainability report. What are you doing for your ESG as a condition of investment?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:22] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So the window of opportunity for ignoring this is fast closing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:25] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> And why not get ahead of it? Why not be that agency that can help your clients with these challenges?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:32] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Although you described that there&#8217;s no badge necessarily for this. It really does feel that for the right client this is a conversation which will win you work. If you can prove that you are going to do this work now, like you said, who&#8217;s going to say no to a more green website? Would you like your website to be much more environmentally friendly than it could have been? Well, no, actually we&#8217;d like it to pollute more, please. That&#8217;s just not a conversation you&#8217;re going to get into.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:56] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> Exactly. Exactly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:58] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That&#8217;s interesting. So the only piece that I can see in this conference where anything is mentioned about the environment is hosting. And even that, it&#8217;s probably I don&#8217;t know, one in fifty, one in a hundred who have that badge. Talk to us about that side. So obviously we build websites, we&#8217;ve got a computer, we know that it&#8217;s stored somewhere, but tell us about hosting, and what people are doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:22] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> Actually some of the hosting companies here are very green, but you have to consider the political climate. So if you are a hosting company based in Texas, in the US. And you are being told that you have to support big oil because that&#8217;s what runs Texas. You don&#8217;t talk about the fact that you are running your hosting data centers on green energy. So it&#8217;s not that they&#8217;re not. It&#8217;s just that they&#8217;re not, it&#8217;s not necessarily part of their marketing message at this point, because the political climate isn&#8217;t necessarily conducive to that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:55] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So you are saying that the hosting industry broadly are doing a fairly good job of this?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:00] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> Well, some of them are, yeah. I know for a fact a lot of the Google Cloud hosting is green and a lot of the big, they&#8217;re using Google data centers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:09] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That feels like one of the most grounded things that you can do. If you&#8217;re having a website, you can actually go out and look for green hosting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:16] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> And the Green Software Foundation has a little URL. It&#8217;s a little tool. You can literally go and put in your domain name and it will tell you whether it&#8217;s running on a green hosting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:25] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> What is the Green Software Foundation?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:27] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> It&#8217;s a sort of organization that is talking about green software, green web, green all sorts of things. They&#8217;re doing some really interesting stuff. They work a lot with very large organizations. I think to be a member you have, like have to pay up 10,000 pounds or something. It&#8217;s like out of my league to be a member, but it doesn&#8217;t mean I can&#8217;t see what they&#8217;re doing and listen to what they&#8217;re doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They&#8217;ve also got a really interesting free course that you can do on sustainable software development. And it gives you all the background and all the things you should be considering when you&#8217;re building software and websites basically, and the things that you can do to make them run better in a greener way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:09] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> If I wanted to make my website more SEOable, I&#8217;ve got a whole suite of tools available to me. And many of them will give me some sort of data saying, okay, this page is, you&#8217;ve done a good job here. Like a traffic light or something you, you know what I&#8217;m saying? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:25] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> Yep.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:26] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Are there tools similar to that, that we can use in WordPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe it&#8217;s some kind of extension to a browser where we can see what our browsing is doing on the internet. In other words, is there a plugin, something which will show us a dashboard saying, okay this page, based upon the hosting that you&#8217;ve told us you&#8217;re using is consuming or creating this much carbon debt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:51] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> There&#8217;s individual tools at the moment that I am aware of. You can put in a URL and it will say, oh yes, your page is this many grams of CO2. Actually what we&#8217;ve done is something. We&#8217;ve been doing a thing. I did that thing of having a side project to the agency, and we&#8217;ve been building something for the past couple of years, and we&#8217;re about to launch a piece of software. It&#8217;s an extension to WordPress, which will actually, in the dashboard, show you a daily carbon footprint of your website based on daily visits and page views.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:24] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> How is that working then? So presumably the daily page bit is fairly straightforward. This website has been consumed 25,000 times, we can make the connection there. But presumably it must be figuring out, okay, that page had a video on it. This one had nothing but text, and it&#8217;s based upon upon some hosting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:40] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> So we&#8217;re basically measuring the page, a measure of the data or page weight for each page. And then we&#8217;re looking at the visitors to the pages as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:50] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> And are you giving like a score out at the end?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:52] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> We&#8217;re not giving a score at the moment, but eventually when the software&#8217;s launched and there&#8217;s lots of people using it, we will be able to say, oh, actually, in comparison to other people using our software, you are in the top quarter, or bottom quartile or you are in the middle. So we can give some feedback. But more importantly, if you look at it and you use things like traffic, then you can start to see where you should be optimizing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:17] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay. And is this tool going to give you helpful advice on how to optimize it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:22] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> Yes, we&#8217;re building out a knowledge base as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:23] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I was going to say, it&#8217;s all very well saying this page is doing really badly, but, you know, tough luck.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:27] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:28] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So, where will it point me? What are the sort of metrics that you&#8217;re going to be helping me with?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:31] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> We&#8217;ll be helping with all the basics. It&#8217;s actually about empowering the content editors. Because as website theme builders and as website developers and designers, we can build the most amazing AA accessible website that&#8217;s really lightweight and fast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then a year later we could audit it and find, oh, content editors added, you know, 30 images and they didn&#8217;t realize they had to add alt text to each one. And they can have loaded that really large video and not realized that it needed a poster attribute to make sure that the page didn&#8217;t take a long time to load.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what we are trying to do is give that feedback to editors in the browser when they&#8217;re editing the site, in the backend of the admin. Because that continuous measurement, if they see a little spike, or they see that suddenly something&#8217;s changed, they can go in and fix it. Rather than end up just doing an annual check, or checking every so often and ending up with a list of defects to fix, basically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the whole point is, it&#8217;s about designing out people making those unconscious mistakes in the first place. And making sure the website continues to be at the standard it should be at and potentially improves over time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:44] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So slightly off piste a little bit. That&#8217;s lovely. I mean I would hope to be able to see that kind of data and it would be really useful to me as a website builder. What about by just general browsing the internet? Do you know if there&#8217;s any tool which can tell me, right at the end of today Nathan, you&#8217;ve been a poor citizen. Some kind of, I don&#8217;t know, a browser extension or something which tells me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:05] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> I don&#8217;t know that. Nobody&#8217;s ever asked me that question, so I will have to take that away Nathan and I will have to come back to you, because I genuinely don&#8217;t know the answer to that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:13] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I think that would be quite a useful thing to know. At the end of the year, Nathan, your internet use is the equivalent of a 20,000 mile flight or something that would be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:22] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> You must be online a lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:23] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I really am. Yeah. Okay, when are you hoping to get this tool out?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:28] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> We are doing a soft launch, early adopter, by invitation to Indigo Tree clients mid-July.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:33] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay. So really soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:35] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> Yeah. And then from then on we&#8217;ll be building out new features and basically getting it to the point where we can launch it to people as a SaaS product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:45] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So going to go beyond WordPress at some point?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:47] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> Couldn&#8217;t possibly say, but yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:49] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Maybe. Maybe, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:50] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> Well, it depends on the roadmap and it depends what interest we get. And for me it&#8217;s not just about the commercial side of, we to build something that&#8217;s obviously profitable and successful. It&#8217;s actually where can we make the biggest impact? How can we, with what we are doing, make sure that we get the biggest carbon reduction overall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the great thing about when you&#8217;re measuring stuff is we can actually report on global stats that are sort of, you know, a thousand clients and cumulatively this month they have reduced their carbon footprint by this amount. You know, so it is going to be an interesting journey to see how we get on and where the biggest impact can be whilst being commercial as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:26] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. It really does sound interesting. Okay, so we&#8217;re going to have to wrap it up. We&#8217;re probably at the edge of the amount of time that we&#8217;ve got.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where would we go if we are curious about the things that you&#8217;ve talked about? So maybe that&#8217;s a link to your, the product that you&#8217;ve just mentioned. Maybe it&#8217;s just a more general set of resources. What are the two or three top places that you would send people?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:45] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> I&#8217;d definitely have a look at the Green Software Foundation. I would also go to, there&#8217;s a Slack channel in the WordPress. I think they&#8217;re just about to create a team in Core for sustainability. So I&#8217;d be going and talking to them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then I would be keeping an eye on people like Wholegrain Digital. Tom and Vineeta talk about things a lot. Tom&#8217;s got a really great newsletter that you can subscribe to. So there&#8217;s lots of people talking about it, but I think it&#8217;s about figuring out where it fits with your particular clients. And some of our clients are very values based and will immediately go for this. Some people just need that more commercial argument as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:26] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Well, Louise, thank you for telling us all about your efforts regarding sustainability and the environment. It is a genuinely fascinating subject, and my prediction is that this conversation is only going to get louder and louder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:39] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> I hope so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:39] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> As the years go on. Yeah, thank you for talking to me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:41] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> You&#8217;re welcome. Thank you.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today we have <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/louisetowler/\">Louise Towler</a>. She joined me at the recent WordCamp Europe in Athens to talk about websites and making them more sustainable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Louise is the founder of <a href=\"https://indigotree.co.uk/\">Indigo Tree</a>, a UK based agency with deep expertise in WordPress websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She gave a presentation at WordCamp Europe entitled, Digital sustainability: The benefits for business and the environment in which she emphasised the impact websites can have on our planet. Her aim was to deliver practical tips for users and developers to help them make informed decisions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This presentation is the focus of today&#8217;s podcast, and we cover quite a lot of ground.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Louise highlights the significant role which electricity plays in powering data centres and transmitting data to end devices. Even if data centres use renewable energy, there is still a need to address overall electricity consumption. She points out that the internet is the fourth largest polluter globally, surpassing the airline industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We discuss how the continuous and widespread use of the internet has made it difficult to reduce its own impact, whilst still emphasising the importance of the steps we can take to make the internet more energy-efficient.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She suggests ways that we can all make a difference right away; educating clients about the consequences of certain design choices, such as using large videos or autoplay features that require substantial data to load. Optimising videos, images, and other website elements, which makes it possible to reduce data consumption <em>and</em> improve performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The conversation then explores other suggestions such as using modern image formats, using images as placeholders for videos, self-hosted fonts, and considering the carbon footprint of email communications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Louise acknowledges the challenges of discussing environmental concerns with clients whilst also explaining that we have to come up with ways to make clients understand that these decisions are beneficial to them as well. After all, an optimised website is one that is looked upon favourably by search engines. Whilst clients ultimately are the decision makers, informing them about the consequences of their choices can help them be more informed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moving onto WordPress, we talk about the responsibility theme authors play. It’s a crucial role, helping users make sustainable choices. Her agency builds custom themes for clients, which allows them to have full control over design decisions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We get into the subject of how legislation is certainly coming, and so getting in early and understanding the implications of such legislation will help your own endeavours in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Towards the end of the podcast we chat about some of the tools which you can use to assess the impact that your websites have, including a tool which Louise and her team have been working on for the last few years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re interested in how your sites can become more sustainable, this podcast is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Useful links.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://europe.wordcamp.org/2023/session/digital-sustainability-the-benefits-for-business-and-the-environment/\">Louise WordCamp Europe presentation &#8211; Digital sustainability: The benefits for business and the environment</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://indigotree.co.uk/\">Indigo Tree website</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://perfmatters.io/\">Perf Matters plugin</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gravityforms.com/\">Gravity Forms website</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://greensoftware.foundation/\">Green Software Foundation website</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C03JNV77Y57\">Sustainability Slack Channel</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wholegraindigital.com/\">Wholegrain Digital website</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 05 Jul 2023 14:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Nathan Wrigley\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:54:\"Do The Woo Community: What the Client Thinks They Know\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=75453\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"https://dothewoo.io/what-the-client-thinks-they-know/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:385:\"<p>Clients consider they have learned a lot through GPT or by Googling it.

The camp was scheduled for August 5, and organizers had already secured a venue and progressed on moving the camp forward. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Community Team <a href=\"https://dhaka.wordcamp.org/2023/\">published a statement</a> on the event&#8217;s website, which cited the interference of corporate interests: </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>The WordPress Community Team’s primary goal is to support and nurture the WordPress community by enabling organizers to create amazing events that celebrate WordPress, its community, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer/become-an-organizer/representing-wordpress/\">globally shared values</a>. The Community team cannot support the event if a WordCamp is not aligned with these values.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/meetup-program-basics/#the-five-good-faith-rules\">WordPress events benefit the WordPress community as a whole, not specific businesses or individuals</a>. The Community Team expects that WordCamps decisions should be guided by the community’s collective wisdom and not influenced by any one company’s interests. When companies attempt to exert influence on the planning process, the Community Team must step in to mediate. In this instance, we have decided to cancel WordCamp Dhaka 2023.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The Community Team urged the Dhaka community to focus on collaborative organization, companies uplifting the community, and greater diversity in participation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an equally vague <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2023/07/03/incident-report-recent-cancelation-of-a-wordcamp/\">incident report</a> on WordPress.org, which doesn&#8217;t even identify the WordCamp that was cancelled, Community Team contributor Sam Suresh called it &#8220;an unfortunate but necessary decision.&#8221; He summarized the team&#8217;s reasons for the decision:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>The decision to cancel the event was not a result of inadequate planning or insufficient effort on the part of the organizing team. Instead, there were observable actions from local community members to influence decisions that would benefit specific individuals or companies. When this influence did not immediately lead to their desired results, the individuals aimed to undermine the organizing process and event success. While the Community Team took steps to mediate, the inappropriate behavior and actions we saw necessitated the cancelation. This is a rare and extreme decision and underscores the severity of the situation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Suresh said the issues applied to the local meetup group as well, and that all co-organizers and event organizers were removed from their roles and required to repeat their orientation to gain access again. A community deputy and a mentor were also removed from their roles in the project and the companies involved in the infractions were banned from sponsoring WordPress events for a year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;In times of challenges like these, it is important to remember that anyone can organize WordPress events regardless of who they work for and that WordPress community events are for the benefit of everyone, not any one business or individual,&#8221; Suresh said. &#8220;As a community, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/handbook/community-code-of-conduct/#our-expectations\">we will not tolerate harassment or influencing unacceptable behaviors</a>.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shortly after publishing, several community members commented with objections to the level of secrecy around the issues at hand and the people and companies involved. The Community Team&#8217;s nebulous posts on the matter seem to have further scandalized the situation, instead of offering clarity and transparency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This post definitely abides by the ongoing policy of not letting the community know who is being censured by the Community Services team, even in cases of egregious action,&#8221; WordPress marketing and meta contributor Sé Reed commented.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I’ve seen multiple cases of people filing harassment reports and various Code of Conduct violations, and that person/people have had various consequences, including being removed from organizing teams. However, those people then cite various reasons for leaving the team, often outright lying. But because of the secrecy around these cases, no one says otherwise and those people can and often do continue to operate in the community without any repercussions beyond secretly losing their &#8216;official&#8217; role(s).&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reed highlighted the damaging effects of the secrecy surrounding these incidents, most notably that explaining the situation often falls to those who filed the report, as the Community Team abdicates any further responsibility after validating the report.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This action is damaging to the community as a whole, as we do not have a full picture of who we are working with and we continue to unknowingly support and empower people who have not honored their community commitments,&#8221; Reed said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not all participants in the discussion were in favor of The Community Team identifying the individuals involved, but in this situation they demand to know the companies that were banned from sponsoring WordPress events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I’m on the fence about knowing peoples’ names here, but I think people definitely need to know the <strong>companies</strong> involved; actively trying to sabotage a WordPress WordCamp is a serious breach of trust for the community,&#8221; WebDevStudios Director of Engineering Mitch Cantor said. &#8220;Especially when they may turn around and then make money from that said community they tried to sabotage.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dealing with these types of sensitive situations is not an enviable task, but the community, for whom these decisions are designed to serve, is calling for a greater level of transparency regarding those who act in ways that are not aligned with WordPress&#8217; globally shared values.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;One way or the other, protecting folks who have violated the Community Code of Conduct is a policy that very clearly needs to be revisited,&#8221; Reed said.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 03 Jul 2023 19:11:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:18;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:40:\"WordPress.org blog: WordPress 6.3 Beta 3\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=15340\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2023/07/wordpress-6-3-beta-3/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5894:\"<p>WordPress 6.3 Beta 3 is ready for download and testing!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This version of the WordPress software is under development.</strong> <strong>Please do not install, run, or test this version on production or mission-critical websites.</strong> Instead, it is recommended you evaluate Beta 3 on a test server and site. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Get an overview of the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/6-3/\">6.3 release cycle</a>, and check the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\">Make WordPress Core blog</a> for <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/6-3/\">6.3-related posts</a> in the coming weeks for further details.

Last week <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/hackers-actively-exploiting-unpatched-privilege-escalation-vulnerability-in-ultimate-member-plugin\">WPScan reported that Ultimate Member had still not fully patched the vulnerability</a> after multiple inadequate attempts. There was evidence that it was being actively exploited in the wild.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Working through the complexities of this security issue, WPScan researcher Marc Montpas opened a <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/58679#ticket\">ticket</a> on WordPress trac, identifying an issue with the meta key field in the usermeta table using accent insensitive collations:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>Looking at the latest string of vulnerability issues that came up related to the Ultimate Member plugin I discovered that the usermeta table has an accent insensitive collation for the <code>meta_key</code> field. This results in queries for <code>wp_cãpăbilitiës</code> to return the actual <code>wp_capabilities</code> row! See <code>update_metadata()</code> function in wp-includes/meta.php</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Imagine the attack surface this brings. In fact, don&#8217;t imagine, just look at the recent attacks in the wild.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>This particular issue made it more difficult to fully patch the vulnerability in question. Ultimate Member released version 2.6.7 on July 1, 2023, which whitelists for metakeys the plugin stores while sending forms. The plugin&#8217;s security advisory details a few other changes that may affect third-party developers:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>2.6.7 also separates form settings data and submitted data and operates them in 2 different variables. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[It] includes some significant changes to how forms submissions are handled. This may cause 3rd-party modifications to stop working. For Third-party developers, please update your customizations to support the new changes in the latest version</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimate Member recommends users review and delete any unknown administrator accounts, reset all user passwords including the admin, enable SSL and backups, and send any advisories to site members and/or customers about the incident. The plugin&#8217;s developers are working on releasing a feature inside the plugin that will enable the website admin to reset passwords for all users, but it is still being finalized:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>The reason for this is a site using our plugin may have been hacked or injected with malware that sniffs login inputs, because this vulnerability issue is prone to these attacks, we recommend to reset passwords after updating with a security patch. This is to ensure the best protection for your website user’s passwords.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>All Ultimate Member users should update to the latest available version, 2.6.7, which has the patch for the vulnerability. The plugin&#8217;s developers are awaiting more feedback from WPScan and are evaluating all their extensions to ensure they are secure. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 03 Jul 2023 16:22:27 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:20;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"WordPress.org blog: WP Briefing: Episode 59: A Polyglot’s WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?post_type=podcast&p=15281\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2023/07/episode-59-a-polyglots-wordpress/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30292:\"<p>Join WordPress Executive Director Josepha Haden Chomphosy in the 59th episode of the WordPress Briefing.

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>( Intro music )</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:00:39]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have with me Alex Kirk, who is a longtime WordPress contributor and who has been instrumental in recent innovations in the Polyglots&#8217; work. Phase four of the Gutenberg project is native multilingual support, and so I see this work that is being done as instrumental, not only for our global community but in support of what&#8217;s to come in that specific roadmap.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:00:59]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So without further ado, Alex Kirk, welcome to the WordPress Briefing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:01:03]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hello, how are you doing?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:01:05]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m good. I&#8217;m good. Can you, let&#8217;s, because I bet that not a lot of people know who you are, can you first start by just telling me a bit about your work with WordPress, and then let us know what GlotPress is, for those of us who don&#8217;t know yet?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:01:19]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. So, Automattic sponsors me to work in the WordPress project on the Meta team and on the Polyglots team. So I spent time on improving or helping improve the software that powers the translation on WordPress.org. But I also work on the meta team on things like Matrix and evaluating if it would be a good fit for WordPress to switch to Matrix for their chat system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:01:46]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So a lot of really big projects that you work on, all of that kind of stuff that has no easy solutions anymore, is where you are right now. Huh?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:01:56]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, there&#8217;s no clear path, but it&#8217;s our mission to find it. So that&#8217;s part of what makes things interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:02:05]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cool. So for folks who don&#8217;t know too much about the Polyglots team or generally translating WordPress, the software, can you let us know a bit about what GlotPress is?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:02:16]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right. So the translation system that powers WordPress.org is called GlotPress. It used to be a standalone software that was developed a couple of years ago, and it was transformed into a WordPress plugin at some point, and now powers the translation that happens on WordPress.org. So we translate WordPress core there from English to other languages, plugins, themes, block patterns, and it all happens through this software called GlotPress. There are a couple GlotPress installations around the world, but I think the WordPress.org one is one of the bigger ones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:02:55]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Probably, WordPress.org is pretty, pretty massive. Also, I think it&#8217;s great that you said that GlotPress was created a couple of years ago, like that, that indicates to me that you&#8217;re working on a really different timescale than a lot of folks are in WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:03:10]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So Alex, tell me a little bit about what it takes to ship translated WordPress software. So, I mean, for people who don&#8217;t need translated WordPress, like obviously we don&#8217;t have a good idea of what it takes to make sure that WordPress is available in so many languages. So what goes into the work of making sure that that happens?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:03:32]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right, so typically the WordPress software and plugins and themes are primarily created in English. And for it to be available in other languages, it needs to be translated. And for that to be able to happen, the programmers need to make the software translatable. Basically, they&#8217;re providing each English string for the translation software to be available to be transformed, so to speak, into another language and to what it&#8217;s being transformed to. This is what the translators do. So they go into the GlotPress software and see the list of texts that need to be translated and translate it to their language that they speak. Typically there is a process around this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:03:32]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, we&#8217;ve got people who have lots of experience in translation. And specifically in translating WordPress or WordPress plugins. And they&#8217;re kind of the, the people who help ensure good quality of translation. So anybody who&#8217;s working the WordPress project, so basically who has a WordPress.org account, can come in and address the translation. And that translation enters the system, so to speak, in a waiting state. And then somebody who we promoted to be a Translation Editor will come along and take a look at your translation and will approve it or will give you suggestions how to do the translation in a better way, or come up with maybe even a better translation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:05:03]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, when you have like a small thing that&#8217;s just not right, like a missing full stop or something like that. They might just add it for you. And well, as soon as the plugin or software is translated to a certain level of translations those translations will be shipped out to the WordPress installs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:05:20]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, for example, for a plugin, you would reach 90% of translated strings. Those translations will then be basically packed up into zip file, a language pack and delivered to each WordPress so that you can have the translations available there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:05:35]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And is 90% the threshold for plugins only, or is that also the threshold for like themes and the CMS itself?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:05:34]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well. We strive for 100%, I would say.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:05:47]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Good. <em>( laughs )</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:05:48]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, 90% more of a motivational point. To be actually honest, I&#8217;m not sure if the threshold is 90% for every project or even if it&#8217;s actually 90%. It&#8217;s different between different GlotPress installations and it&#8217;s basically something that is made as a setting that can be changed. There&#8217;s, it&#8217;s an arbitrary number. Typically you&#8217;d actually want to make sure that the most important strings are translated first. So the ones like, if you look at the whole picture, software usually consists of many parts, many of whom are not encountered by people on a regular basis. For example, error messages that could be like obscure error messages, and you could argue that those might be not as important. Or even sometimes you could even say like, do they need to be translated? Because if you encounter an error message and you search the internet, wouldn&#8217;t you probably want everybody to search for the English one to find the solution? But that set-aside, it&#8217;s important to have like the headline of the plugin or like the most important strings translated, and typically translating those most important strings will take you to a pretty high percentage so that we can then say it&#8217;s good enough to be shipped.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:07:02]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gotcha. I see, I see. Okay. Well, we talked a bit earlier about GlotPress&#8217;s timeline. It has been around for a bit, I know. But with that kind of in mind, have there been any notable changes to GlotPress recently?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:07:19]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, so I think for GlotPress there&#8217;s been a bit of an up and down over time in terms of engagement and progress on the software. But in, in the recent year, I think we&#8217;ve added a couple of things that have been very helpful for translators. So one of them was adding the commenting functionality, so yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:07:35]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Super helpful. Shocked it wasn&#8217;t there before. Sorry, translators. Sorry, all of our polyglots.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:07:40]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, it can be like there was when GlotPress was created there, there is like the, a big part of GlotPress are these states, like the waiting state when you enter translation, and then there&#8217;s approved state, which basically a translation we say it&#8217;s set to current, and there&#8217;s all sorts of process around it. So if the software is updated or translation might get fuzzy. But also like, if somebody submits a translation that doesn&#8217;t fully conform to what&#8217;s the translation editors, or like what the standards of the translation community have been set to, then you would have to need to reject it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:08:16]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that has been something that we felt wasn&#8217;t a very good and enticing way of telling people like, we appreciate your work. It wasn&#8217;t just quite right, but it&#8217;s more of a rejection. So this is how we came up with this like, let&#8217;s give people the option to say what was wrong and give them a chance to try again without making them feel rejected.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:08:38]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Sort of a &#8220;No, but&#8230;&#8221; as opposed to a, just refusal to receive it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:08:45]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And other things that we&#8217;ve worked on is, like, with the recent search of AI, like getting help from AI on translation and also on reviews. So, there&#8217;s some interesting things that you can do with AI in that regard; that one important aspect of translations, it&#8217;s also that we&#8217;ve got glossaries for each language where people, basically the translation community, identifies certain words they want to translate them the same way every time.&nbsp;And with the AI, you can basically add to the prompt, like, please translate those words to those translations when you give me a translation for that. And as it can change over time, you can always adapt this to the prompt, and that has been proven quite helpful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:09:25]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is great. That&#8217;s one of those things I know that AI has been like a really popular thing to talk about. And AI, specifically for translations, I think has caused some concern that maybe we&#8217;ll just like translate it all and hope that computers get it right when we know pretty certainly that computers don&#8217;t always get the translations right. But that&#8217;s not what you&#8217;re talking about, right? What you&#8217;re suggesting is that AI would suggest what could be translated and what it could be translated to, and then human beings have to confirm that that&#8217;s correct, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:09:59]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s exactly it. So basically, we give suggestions to the translators, and then they can modify a translation before they press save. It&#8217;s more of a, like supporting them in getting the translations, like looking up words more quickly and all of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:10:16]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s wonderful. So is that the major sort of next step that is coming for GlotPress, or are there other things that we should keep an eye out for in that software?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:10:27]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So one direction that we&#8217;ve been taking GlotPress is basically making use of the fact that GlotPress is WordPress plugin now. And you know, typically, you would just use a GlotPress install. So on WordPress.Org, there&#8217;s like GlotPress installed, there&#8217;s translation projects created, something that we call &#8220;translation sets&#8221;. So for languages, you want to translate it to, it&#8217;s all pre-configured, and if you would install GlotPress to plugin on your own WordPress, it would be empty and not very useful. So what we&#8217;ve added is a way for you to basically be able to translate the plugins and themes that you&#8217;ve got installed in your WordPress into the language that you&#8217;re interested in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:11:07]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you might have a non-English website that you want to use certain plugins with, and they might not be fully translated at this point, so obviously, you could go to WordPress.org and help translate them, and that&#8217;s the way to, that&#8217;s preferred. But you could also now go install GlotPress on your own website and translate there. And then you have the translations there right when you enter them. And you can then contribute those translations back to WordPress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:11:35]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s with local GlotPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:11:37]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s something that we call local GlotPress. And you know, since we then have all these translations in the local database, it means we can do even more with those translations. So typically, language packs would be delivered to WordPress, but with local GlotPress, you&#8217;ve got like all the GlotPress software there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:11:56]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we can do things like inline translation. So, on your own WordPress and wp-admin, for example, we can highlight all the strings that can be translated, and those strings just have to right-click them and enter your translation, and that way, you can basically go about and translate the whole ui, seeing your progress, as you&#8217;re making, basically turning the screen from red to green.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:12:20]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Yeah. So that&#8217;s something now that you can do in your local WordPress installation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:12:26]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Basically, it&#8217;s completely independent of WordPress.org. We would ask you to contribute the translations back when you have them, but being independent also allows you to translate like premium plugins, which could not be hosted on WordPress.org or doing something like that we call like hyper-local translation. So, for example, I speak Austrian German natively, but even inside Austria, we&#8217;ve got different dialects or like special words that we use. And if I wanted to create a website that&#8217;s targeted at the Viennese market, for example, I might want to use those specific terms. And this is something I would have to argue for those translations to be accepted on WordPress.org because it&#8217;s a, it&#8217;s like a very targeted market. But if I have a local GlotPress, I can do those translations there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:13:11]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That seems awfully beneficial, especially as dialects. I&#8217;ve been having these conversations. I have, in my extended family, many children, and they are all learning languages and one of them has been having kind of thoughts about, like, dialects and how dialects are almost another language. And if so, like how do you know what everybody&#8217;s saying when you&#8217;re speaking all the same thing, but it&#8217;s kind of a little bit it sounds a little bit different.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:13:37]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s certainly a thing in the US, the distinct dialects across our country. And so I imagine that that&#8217;s gonna be a really beneficial sort of implementation for countries that have a lot of different regional variations and certainly smaller countries that have technically the same language as somebody else, but a lot of regional differences, regional specific things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:14:01]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is that the same or different as the live translations, Translate Live, that we talked about at the WordCamp Europe a couple weeks back?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:14:12]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right. So, Translate Live is kind of the next step after local GlotPress. It&#8217;s like this happy marriage between the WordPress Playground and local GlotPress. So the WordPress Playground is also something that has come up a lot. It&#8217;s basically a way for you to run WordPress inside a browser window, so in JavaScript. And at first, it seems like mildly interesting, I would say. But when you combine it with other things like local GlotPress, it can lead to really interesting opportunities. So with inline translation, for example, on WordPress.org, you would typically find for every plugin, the UI would look the same. You would have a table of strings, and all that makes you realize you&#8217;re translating this certain plugin is that in the header of the page, it says this name of the plugin, but other than that, it can look really all the same.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:15:07]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now, with WordPress Playground, you can put up a WordPress and run this plugin inside that Playground. And now, if you add local GlotPress to the picture, you can also do the inline translation of that plugin inside the WordPress Playground. So you&#8217;ve got inline translation. We add the glossary so they do make sure that you translate things the same way that they&#8217;re expected, and you don&#8217;t have to install the plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:15:33]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And still, you can see what the translations will look like. You can see the strings next to each other, and what I think is most important, you will start with the strings that you see first, which are the most important ones. When you&#8217;re in the table view, those strings might be somewhere buried in the middle, and yeah, it&#8217;s really hard to see progress if you start with kind of obscure error messages, for example, versus just starting with the things that you see first.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:16:02]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. So, moving translations away from table-based translations where you kind of have to know what you&#8217;re looking for. So the Translate Live, along with local GlotPress, along with WP Playground, is going to make it so that it&#8217;s easier to see visually what needs to be translated, where, what&#8217;s most valuable to translate for your mid users and your end users, basically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:16:30]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That, and also like for plug-in authors, it can be really good to see, you know, you can switch the languages in the Playground to another language, and you can quickly see like what&#8217;s the state of the translation in this language or in that language. And even things like, you know, Arabic as an RTL language rights to left language. The sidebar will change to the right, and you can also just switch language and see like, what&#8217;s my plugin like in this environment. I mean, this is not technically something that&#8217;s related to local GlotPress, but in this translation live ui, it&#8217;s very easy to change languages and see your plugin in another language.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:17:06]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, it&#8217;s not specifically related to, to Translations Live, but also, I think that if we&#8217;re saying that WordPress not necessarily is going to lead the way with translations and native multilingual support in our CMS because, of course, it&#8217;s still a little bit far out on our roadmap. We certainly have an opportunity to have the best implementation of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:17:27]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And even if like that specific use case that you&#8217;re talking about isn&#8217;t related directly to what it is that you are working on for Polyglots and inside GlotPress and all of that, I do see that having more streamlined, more easy to see and access opportunities to like test the way that our software looks across varying environments, especially those that change it substantially from what we typically work in day-to-day for any individual developer or any individual WordPress site implementer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:18:00</strong>]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, I think that that is a big step forward for all of us and certainly for anyone who is having to use WordPress as not a native English speaker. And so you say it&#8217;s not related, but it still is a big, a big benefit for WordPress overall, I think, to have this kind of work happening so that we can have those benefits to the folks who are using our software.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:18:22]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there were a couple of different things that you mentioned over the course of our conversation. We&#8217;re gonna put some links to the show notes for all of those. But one thing that you mentioned that just kind of went by, and we never really had an opportunity to talk about it. You talked about the, I think it was GTEs, Global Translation Editors, the folks that are like approved as final approvers of translations. If there is someone who&#8217;s listening to this podcast who wants to become a GTE someday, where would they go to do that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:18:54]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the path to GTE is a PTE.&nbsp;<em>( laughs )</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:18:59]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, we&#8217;ve got different levels of translation editors. Basically, you start, you could say you start off as a translator, and this is how you can kind of show that you can do good translations or that you&#8217;re very firm in your language. And this might make you be noticed in the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:19:16]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we&#8217;re always looking for people who like to help with translations. And you might be then promoted to be a Project Translation Editor. Basically, it means that for a single language in a project, you&#8217;ll be able to approve translations. So, you&#8217;ll be the one who says, like, this translation is a good one and this conforms to the to the rules that we have stated as a translation community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:19:42]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And further down the path then is the GTE, where you basically are allowed to approve translations across any project on translate.WordPress.org in your language. And that&#8217;s, usually you&#8217;ll be in, in that position with other GTEs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:20:04]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there is, like, in each community, there is like, we&#8217;re people based. We talk about what might be a good translation. We talk to each other, try to find rules that maybe prevent common mistranslations, or set the standards for how we want the software to be translated. And this is something where you get a voice as a translator, but as a GTE, you get into a position where you can actually make the changes or find consensus on how the software should be translated in your language.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:20:35]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if folks are not familiar where the Polyglots team works and meets, where would they find you all?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:20:41]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>At make.WordPress.org/polyglots.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:20:45]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perfect. Alex, this has been such a fascinating conversation. Thank you so much for joining me today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:20:50]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you very much.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>( Intermission music )</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:20:59]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that brings us now to our small list of big things. First, WP Campus 2023 is taking place July 12th through the 14th. That&#8217;s a nonprofit three-day conference with topics that focus on the growth of higher education, accessibility, WordPress, and anyone who works in higher education.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:21:17]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a hybrid event. There is an in-person component on the beautiful campus of Tulane University in New Orleans, Louisiana. I&#8217;ll add information about that in our show notes for anyone who would like to join in person or online.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:21:32]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing is that the mentorship program pilot that I have been talking about a little bit over the last few months has been formally launched.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:21:39]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are interested in contributing more to the project but not sure where to begin, take a look at this comprehensive onboarding experience. It&#8217;s cohort-based. It has some personalized one-to-one mentorship. There are guided courses, live workshops, all of that. So read more about it in our show notes and sign up for one-on-one team mentorship.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:21:59]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, finally, Matt mentioned at WordCamp Europe an idea that he had been thinking of for some time a Make team dashboard that would sort of help define team metrics and help identify for individual contributors what should indicate team health and where they can find the most impactful projects to work on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:22:20]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A post has since been published on make.WordPress.org/meta calling for additional feedback on that idea, so that we have an understanding of what this could be, how the dashboard can kind of come to be. And so stop by and add your thoughts there in the comments.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:22:38]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is your small list of big things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:22:42]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing.

In today&#8217;s episode, we will talk about Gutenberg 6.1, WordPress 6.3 and that&#8217;s pretty much it. We have a full program alone with that. I&#8217;m your host, Birgit Pauli-Haack, curator at the Gutenberg Times and full-time core contributor for WordPress open source project sponsored by Automattic. And I&#8217;m so happy that Tammie Lister joins me today. She&#8217;s one of the Gutenberg design leads of phase one and design lead of WordPress 6.3 release squad and will be the editor tech co-lead on the all underrepresented gender squad for 6.4. In her day job Tammie works at the global agency Inpsyde from Germany as a developer. Good afternoon, Tammie. So happy to see you again. Thank you so much for making the time to be on the show. How are you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: I am great. Thank you so much for having me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Oh, it&#8217;s so wonderful. And for our longtime listeners, you are no stranger. You&#8217;ve been on the Gutenberg Live Q&amp;A few years ago, and you were part of the last year&#8217;s developer hours, and it&#8217;s actually the first time that you&#8217;re on the podcast. How did that happen? For those of you listening for the first time, tell me a little bit about your WordPress work and what you&#8217;re doing now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: So my WordPress journey has been a long one and an awesome one. Like a lot of people, I started out by blogging and poking around themes and then I worked for a long time on the problems with themes, went via core through BuddyPress and then for a long time I worked as creating themes and working through that. And that&#8217;s where I started really my contribution journey through the theme review team and a little bit in core. And then Gutenberg, I guess it was my adventure by Gutenberg. The seed of Gutenberg is rooted in a lot of people from the theming background. It&#8217;s one of those not so hidden facts about Gutenberg, that a lot of people who worked on it had that background as well. And I&#8217;ve been really lucky since I worked on that project, to have quite an adventure working in various roles from design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And at the moment, I&#8217;m really lucky to be balancing back my developer skills. I&#8217;ve always done both, but at the moment I&#8217;m really focusing on how can I raise back up those skills, and I&#8217;m really lucky to be doing that in an agency role. So I am now getting to work with this amazing thing that we&#8217;ve created in the editor and getting to implement it within the agency at a development level so that I&#8217;m having all sorts of fun now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, I can imagine that. That&#8217;s awesome. Well, thank you so much and yes, so you will have opinions about the extensibility of Gutenberg, which is one of the top…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: Only a few.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: That will come or that has been in the background or in the other current of all the new features, where&#8217;s the extensibility or how can we extend this?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Announcements</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So before we dive into the recent releases, I want to tell you dear listeners all about the two live Q&amp;As that are coming up in July. So next week, we have on July 6, 2023 at 17:00 UTC and I&#8217;m not going to convert this to any other time right now. Time zones are the bane of my existence at the moment. So we have the topic, leveraging Gutenberg&#8217;s architecture to take plugin development to new levels, and we learn about how Gutenberg components and scripts can be used outside the block editor to revamp a plugins code base.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this is a case study of GiveWP 3.0, how that&#8217;s come about and we will have a guest, Jason Adams, who&#8217;s the director of development and Jon Waldstein, who&#8217;s the lead developer on the show. And my co-host will be Lena Morita who is a JavaScript developer on the components team. So she has some really geeky questions for the two and she&#8217;s quite excited about it, and I&#8217;m really looking forward to it because I find it fascinating when developers discover all the ways to use existing components and script to build on top of Gutenberg. And it saves so much development time and it opens up new synergies between the core and the added functionality in a plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you&#8217;re interested to dive in, the next one, two weeks later on July 21st, also at 17:00 UTC, we will hold the next live Q&amp;A with designers and developers of WordPress VIP, and they created a bridge plugin between Figma design themes and the theme JSON file for the classic and block themes. And it&#8217;s a fascinating way to keep faithful to the existing design systems and start spinning up new sites that mirror that design system without a whole lot of friction in between us. My co-host will be Joni Halabe from the web team at Georgetown University, also a very interesting live Q&amp;A. I&#8217;m really happy that we&#8217;re putting it together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The last one, you have to just subscribe to the newsletter so you get early access to it, newsletter at the Gutenberg Times and should you listen to this episode, I know a lot of people binge listen to it. If you listen to this episode after July 22nd, check out the Gutenberg Times YouTube channel for the recordings of that. We always record them, we have them transcribed, we have a post on the Gutenberg Times with the resources shared and all that. So even if you miss it, but the live Q&amp;A is really interesting because all of a sudden from the demos that are there, there comes these very quick questions from the audience and I really like having that a live show. So that&#8217;s that.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What’s Released &#8211; WordPress 6.3</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We are coming to the what&#8217;s released section and we come to what happened last night. So today, we are recording it on Thursday, June 28th and this morning in I think 1:30, WordPress 6.3 beta two was released. And were you up at that time?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: No, I got up as far as about just hitting 11:00 UK time at night and I could see it wasn&#8217;t going to be the 11:00, so I left the amazing people that were doing and I&#8217;d kept going that far, and I bowed out and got some sleep because it was the second night running.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, there was a second shift coming in from Australia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: Which is amazing. That&#8217;s part of the global project. We all get to open doors and close doors after each other, leave post-it notes virtually up for each other. There was a lot of that going on for the past two days and I think that&#8217;s the important thing. It&#8217;s been two days we&#8217;ve been working to get this out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, the make blog has one was the delay for one day and then also the explanation why it&#8217;s now called beta two instead of beta one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: Systems are hard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Systems are hard, releases are hard. I have switched my role for this release from doing for three releases, dev notes wrangling to actually be editor triage, co-lead with four other people. And this has been quite an interesting experience because all of a sudden, I&#8217;m looking behind the scenes and how timely a lot of PRs are to getting into the beta. And then it&#8217;s not only that there&#8217;s in the plugin, but you also need to sync the core data, the PHP code with the Gutenberg code and that is another big adventure for the tech leads. And you get to do this, when is it? In September before beta 6.4.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: Yeah. And I think you never know the unknowns until you know them and then you document, and then you try and that&#8217;s the important part of this amazing journey that is these big projects. You can predict most things but it&#8217;s always going to be the thing that you don&#8217;t predict. Honestly, we are doing incredible. Everyone is doing incredible. We just have to remember humans’ need to sleep sometimes and I think that is the beauty we learn. One of the amazing things we do now, which we didn&#8217;t do before is we have the use of the time zones. We use that. We have multiple leads. I think back even a few years ago, we didn&#8217;t have that for these roles and by having that, we can take advantage of time zones and lives and different people, but just documenting and writing, I think there&#8217;s going to be some like, &#8220;Okay, so that could happen.&#8221; Okay, now we document this, now we learn this and that&#8217;s great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s stuff I now want to learn about. My curious brain is like, &#8220;Okay, well this went wrong. Okay, so how do we learn?&#8221; And that&#8217;s great because our documentation gets better. That&#8217;s generally what happens in between releases where people debrief and then take everything that happened in a release and then the next release gets better each time. We rise on the past release each time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Right, yeah. As you know, this big project, nobody really knows everything. So the collaborative effort is…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: And if they claim to, I really think they need to go for a little walk in the countryside and think about themselves because nobody does and that&#8217;s amazing. You&#8217;ve just got to be very humble and just go, &#8220;Okay, on we go.&#8221; I just wanted to say shout out to everyone that was working so hard the past 48 hours and then some. You saw some beautiful handovers of patches, people just teleporting in on their phones and doing things and just some amazing open source hearts. You saw a lot of that going on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And I saw a lot of also the humbleness stuff. I don&#8217;t know, does somebody else is able to help me?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: I don&#8217;t know, but I might know someone who does in their mental Rolodex going through a list of people, and that&#8217;s amazing to do. It&#8217;s not like I might know, I&#8217;m going to struggle with it for a while and then I&#8217;m not going to come up with a good solution. That does not help anybody.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: No, no, no. At that moment, you need somebody who knows. But it&#8217;s also…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tammie Lister: It would help otherwise you make it worse. It&#8217;s like the I will fix this and make it worse. Nobody needs that at 10:00 at night.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Not on a software that&#8217;s used by millions of people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: But a beta is a beta. And I think that&#8217;s the amazing thing we all have to&#8230; Now, let&#8217;s test it now let&#8217;s poke it and do things and nothing is ever going to be bug free. We always want that, but we do our best every time. I am so excited about how big this changelog is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, we&#8217;re getting to that. But I just wanted to do a shout-out for Brian Alexander who&#8217;s heading the test team. He has put together some amazing instructions on how you can make really impactful contributions to this open source project and we will share the link in the show notes. So when you go to the test <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/2023/06/27/help-test-wordpress-6-3/\">make.webpress.org/test</a>, that&#8217;s the first post that will come up is help test WordPress 6.3. There are quite a few features coming in and they all need testing and they all need hitting the real life scenarios. Have plugins that use some of that, themes, just poke it from all the ends and it&#8217;s really necessary. And like every beta, it&#8217;s beta, but the bugs that we find now in the beta two, three and four, we don&#8217;t have to fix later when the release is done. So yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Gutenberg 16.1</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>What also was released was Gutenberg 16.1 and that&#8217;s when 255 PRs merged with this release by 69 contributors and it&#8217;s just amazing what all went in there. It&#8217;s also understandable because if it went for the last minute, nothing really gets done in life, I found. And everybody wanted to get their work merged, so it will be in the next WordPress release and with the beta this week, it&#8217;s the last plugin release for enhancements and new features to come in. After that, it&#8217;s all bug fixing. So that made it for a mile long changelog. And Tammie and I will do our best to pick the stars amongst the 255, the bright shining stars and the highlights for you and talk them through. So do you want to hit us off with the first thing or do you have any other comments to add?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: Wow, the amount. I guess the first one would be the navigation menu sidebar, the renaming, duplication, and deleting of navigation menus from browse mode sidebar. Navigation menu sidebar, the maturity of that in general, it feels such a long adventure the navigation menu has come on and I think that&#8217;s also maybe this point is why there was so much as well. It&#8217;s not the final-final release, it&#8217;s like Photoshop when you name a final-final 01 file or something, but it&#8217;s a closure and I think having a navigation block, having things changed, all these things, it&#8217;s a closure for a lot of these features. So I think navigation, it feels like quite a closure on some of these things as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And it now made real sense. I think it really needed to gruel it and often and throw out concepts and get new ones there. So there&#8217;s navigation and then there is the sidebar menu in the site editor that also has a navigation piece to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: But bringing that functionality means that you then&#8230; There&#8217;s this weird separation, but it allows that to feel more cohesive and native. That&#8217;s the best words I can think of it. I think navigation&#8217;s going to take a little while to get a lot of people using because navigation&#8217;s over here and all these kinds of things. It&#8217;s that maturity of that feature and the dependability of that feature and the work there. I&#8217;ve definitely started feeling that it feels more robust to use with these changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: It&#8217;s pretty exciting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And I finally feel the same way. I was always a little hesitant to touch the navigation because I knew it wasn&#8217;t finished. So I didn&#8217;t want…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: You sneeze near it, it&#8217;ll fall over, bless it. And I say that having worked on it myself, but it&#8217;s just a really hard problem. Turns out navigation&#8230; Linking alone is a hard problem, but navigation is linking plus plus plus. It&#8217;s a really difficult problem. If you just write code, it felt easier. But if soon as you add any interface, it&#8217;s really difficult.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And it&#8217;s also such a prominent piece of a website that you build, that it really needs to…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: And people are very bonded to a particular way of using navigation in WordPress as well. So we&#8217;ve got to retrain that mindset.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, that definitely is true. And so we have the navigation and the sidebar and the site editor as a navigation menu where you can do certain things and from that menu, from that sidebar, you already can rename, duplicate menus, or delete them. You cannot create them. That&#8217;s what you do when you create, you add a navigation block to a template part to the header or to the footer and then on the right hand sidebar on the white sidebar, that&#8217;s where you assemble your menu or the many menus.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: I like that consciousness of creating them somewhere else. There there&#8217;s so many opinions on separation and workflows. I feel like&#8230; This is a complete personal opinion, but making navigation too easy, I think that you end up with too many navigation everywhere. That&#8217;s always been one of our problems, that you end up with people drowning in menus. So I think that there&#8217;s a balance that there&#8217;s a maturity of navigation. I think that&#8217;s where the overlap of this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, definitely. And I like that in the site editor left side navigation, you just touch on the overall website, but you always go into the canvas to actually make changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: The best words I can use is assembly there. I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s a good word, but it feels like assembly there, functionality doing here. And then that&#8217;s what it feels like. The different mental models that I&#8217;m moving in between when I&#8217;m doing things and I&#8217;m for that, different areas having very distinct different mental models when I&#8217;m doing it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And I like that too because I can&#8217;t have two different thoughts in my head at the same time and be productive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: Life&#8217;s too short.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. So that&#8217;s why I like the next item, that the footnotes block is now coming to text blocks and that&#8217;s really something that we have all been waiting for a long time. And I know that Ella van Durpe has also tried multiple ways to get this done and I think she has such great ideas that she all pursued them all. And in the GitHub, you can have the history of all the footnotes, but I think this version is really hitting it out of the park. It works well. You put the cursor where you need the footnote, you get it from the menu from the inside menu bar menu dropdown on the block toolbar, and then you say footnote, and then it gets you right into the place where the content of the footnote, you can add that and it does the numbering itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you say, &#8220;Oh, I put a footnote in the middle of a paragraph, but also I need another one on top of it,&#8221; it recounts them so automatically. So that&#8217;s a really good feature. And it has color controls, but it also follows whatever your paragraph or your link color is. I just see that when you change the background of a paragraph, you get what you always get with links is if you change the text, you also need to change the link color. But that is something that&#8217;s the nature of the beast and there is no automation for that. But I&#8217;m really happy that this block comes and it will be in 6.3.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: Footnotes has an adventure for many years. I think footnotes is one of those, to me, it&#8217;s a sign of maturity for an editor. Quite a few see it as extra functionality or features. But it really is something that if you are in a particular field or you are particularly using, that you will not use an editor unless it has the footnotes functionality. It&#8217;s whether you choose to use or not. There&#8217;s no doubt whether you would want, you wouldn&#8217;t even have a plugin. It would be base functionality. So I think I am very glad to see it. Also, it&#8217;s a really strong indicator of things like collaboration. It sets that. It may not feel like it, but it is. It sets those using that canvas in a little bit of a different way as well. So I&#8217;m really pleased to see it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: And that experimenting outside to then bring in, I think is a real good way forward to start seeing the interface as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, definitely. Definitely. And then you could actually move the footnotes block where all the footnotes are to the end of things or put them a little bit further. So it&#8217;s also quite versatile.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: That&#8217;s really important depending on what article you&#8217;re writing as well. I do not claim to know any different medical whatever articles, but I&#8217;m sure that there are certain rules and regulations around where things go and depending on articles and what order things go. So having that functionality that you can determine yourself is better for everybody.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: The next big one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yep, go ahead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: I feel like there&#8217;s a whole episode here on patterns and I guess the big one here is the naming and language to me is&#8230; Again, we talk about maturity, well renaming reusable blocks, rename to my patterns and add option to also add a non-synced pattern. This is big, it&#8217;s a small big thing I guess because it&#8217;s a big thing, but it&#8217;s not a massive feature, is it? But it also is a massive feature. Reusable blocks are quite limited but really quite bonded for some people. So I think that we got to respect that. But patterns to me are what everyone always wanted with reasonable blocks. When everyone describes what they want from a reusable block, it&#8217;s a mature functional pattern that has all the things that patterns are getting like syncing, all these things. And that&#8217;s what patterns are getting now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I don&#8217;t know what you feel, but that to me it&#8217;s just maturity of patterns, you have blocks, patterns, template parts, templates. It makes sense.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Oh yeah, yeah. They&#8217;re pretty much cut from the same cloth and all had different names and also different models. So you had to get here for template parts, you need to go there for a reusable block and you had a pattern here, but they all had different updates kind of thing. So if you update a reusable block, it updates on all instances. A pattern doesn&#8217;t have any updates, so every time you put them into a canvas, they are all disintegrating. They don&#8217;t know about itself anymore. But what I like is that you now can create your own patterns and that is something that a lot of people were missing, that you were dependent on the pattern directory or you were dependent on the theme to provide your patterns or some third-party directory where you can copy paste it over, but you are not able to say, &#8220;Oh, this is a marvelous pattern. Can I store that on my site?&#8221; And now you can.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s the same interface or same workflow that you are accustomed to when you create a reusable block and there&#8217;s only one change there&#8230; Well, one attribute, it&#8217;s called sync this over all the instances, yes or no, it&#8217;s a toggle switch. So if you switch it on, you get a reusable block that if you change it, it changes all the instances. And if you switch it not on, it&#8217;s a pattern which does not update. But this is also, and you say, &#8220;Okay, but I want, when I change the style of my pattern, I want it to be replicated over all the instances.&#8221; It&#8217;s coming. This is the first step. This is the first step to unify the wording, unify the interface. And then also, you don&#8217;t have this duplicate mental model anymore. You find them and you can edit them at the same spaces. It&#8217;s called my custom patterns. That&#8217;s how you find them in the pattern list. And then in the block when you highlight them, there is manage your patterns. So it&#8217;s a great step and it&#8217;s one that we have been really all waiting for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: And putting my agency hat on, really trying to explain all this language. People, they work in design systems, they work in simple language and been able to sell this easier by simpler language that it behaves more like a design system as they expect. This all is that. You don&#8217;t have to then build a system on top because then the system will be easily done within, you don&#8217;t then have to bring the system. So I am very excited about this. It is the start. It is something that I would&#8217;ve liked a couple of years ago, but we had so much to do. We&#8217;ll get there. And I think that is the thing of there&#8217;s so much changing to do. Patterns are really getting strong. When they first came out, it felt like, &#8220;Oh, you can do patterns.&#8221; But they are so powerful. People get patterns way more than blocks as well. If you explain a block, people are like, &#8220;You don&#8217;t need to make blocks.&#8221; And I think we&#8217;re going to see less blocks people making and more patterns with this because patterns are just more useful then.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: That&#8217;s what I have been seeing as well is also that people say, &#8220;Okay, I don&#8217;t have to create a custom block just because I want a group of blocks in my site.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: As much as I love block variations, I love all these things that you can do because blocks were amazing. I&#8217;d like to see less because then it means that patterns are doing what they&#8217;re meant to do because that&#8217;s what humans see. The interface that we&#8217;re having for pattern browsing and all that, we&#8217;re getting onto the management stuff that&#8217;s also part of this, that is just better as a human. Those human interfaces, once humans are using that, that&#8217;s way better than the tiny little pickers that we have for blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. But I wanted to go back to what you said, while I would love to have it two years ago, but I think sometimes waiting helps you really to see the big picture, the whole picture. So two years ago, we didn&#8217;t have template parts, yeah?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Or we didn&#8217;t know yet how they&#8217;re going to fit in into the block themes and in pattern, we&#8217;re just at the beginning, but we didn&#8217;t know how to lock them. How to lock certain pieces of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: When I say that, that&#8217;s just eagerness and that&#8217;s also…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yes, impatience. I see it, I want it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: Way too many people in the agency just want it tomorrow because honestly, those are the people who are trying to solve it with design systems who are trying to work around the problem today. Absolutely, these toys are amazing. And that then means these bigger systems can start using. They don&#8217;t have to build on top or around. They can build a lot more natively and the more native you can build, the easier upgrades, the easier components, everything. And it&#8217;s just a better experience for everybody.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Right, right. Or you see the power now and you say, &#8220;Oh, wouldn&#8217;t it be great? And then you have to wait.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: If no one ever has to go through a load of patterns and I&#8217;ve actually had to do this, go through someone makes a change in patterns, but this was quite a while ago. If you use patterns and then you had to make a change in patterns at scale, that was hard to do before. Not having to do that, that&#8217;s going to be amazing. So getting all the amazing benefits of all these things, but having the amazing benefits of things like reusable blocks, but with these visual benefits that humans have. Yeah, it&#8217;s amazing. We have all the toys.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And there&#8217;s one more toy coming, which is now you can get a preview of block themes in your site. We all remember the customizer where you install a theme on your website and then you use the customizer and you were able to preview your site with the theme. And that hasn&#8217;t happened yet, but now it&#8217;s here for block themes as well. You see where you have all your themes, you see a live preview button and that gets you into a similar interface as the site editor. And then you can navigate your site with the theme that is installed but not activated yet. So you can see how your blocks behave, you see how your posts behave, and in advance you don&#8217;t have this what Helen Hou-Sandí always calls the save and pray feature there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: What you see might maybe what you get, but possibly not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Probably different, yes. And it&#8217;s amazing to see this in block themes. You also see all the style variations and how they would change your website and it&#8217;s really amazing. And it&#8217;s in 16.1 and it will come to 6.3 soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister:</em> And moving on to the site editor, the distraction free. We&#8217;ve had distraction free, so it&#8217;s like ta-da. But having that with the site editor, been able to create and just go get away. I remember&#8230; Age, that Dreamweaver full screen mode. And you now got that. The day where you could suddenly do visual in Dreamweaver, we&#8217;ve now got that in WordPress. Wow. It&#8217;s incredible to think that we can do that and you&#8217;ve got that without some of the ickiness. Bless it. Without tables. But we&#8217;ve now got that and that means that you can really focus on what you&#8217;re creating. And sometimes like if you&#8217;re doing some of these three-column query or whatever when you&#8217;re trying to do, you do not need those side panels and everything in the way. So distraction free is really, really nice to be able to do that and create.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We talked earlier about modes when you&#8217;re doing things that really helps you with that creation mode, there&#8217;s a reason why when you are writing, you have those zen modes and that really works for people. Or you have that get away from my desktop all the apps. I don&#8217;t know what you feel, but I think this is just a small improvement to life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Absolutely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: Quality of life improvement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Absolutely. And it&#8217;s a good one, when you can do an almost one-to-one preview of your site for that particular page, it opens up so much or it takes away so much worry. It&#8217;s really a better life there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: Know what you&#8217;re getting rather than guessing what you&#8217;re getting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And test this, please test this so much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: Yeah. And again, that&#8217;s the part of this. A lot of these things, they&#8217;re going in and they&#8217;ve been tested by the people that are creating them and they&#8217;re amazing humans, but they are not the people that are going to be poking it. It&#8217;s now up to people that are listening to this, the people that are going to be testing, who are the people that should be poking it and using it. And I think that is exactly what this is about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Absolutely, absolutely. And what is now coming back to the site editor is editing templates as well as content. At the beginning of when the site editor was introduced, it was already there, but people got confused. Am I editing a page? Or they were not confused. They didn&#8217;t have that concept of a template part like this is just the template that drives all the pages and they made changes, and then were surprised that the changes were duplicated on all the pages. So it was taken out of the editor, and now it comes back with some guidance for the content creator of, &#8220;Okay, you can edit that now and when you&#8217;re in the template, you get all this whole title kind of thing.&#8221; It names the things that are in there. And when you&#8217;re on a page, it gives you the page title exactly how you put it in and then you can edit it. But when you go into the places where the template is, it tells you this is a template piece, do you want to edit now? And then gets you out of the editing mode into a template editing mode.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think that the guardrails there really help with the mental image as well. This is a template, I don&#8217;t want to screw that up. I just want this on my page. I want that content done. And you can do it in the site editor. Do you have to go back to the WP admin? Once in a while when you create pages, yes, yeah. But sometimes you want to edit things and you want to see it with&#8230; that&#8217;s the good part in this section now when you have the edit the page content as well as the template, is you see the page and it&#8217;s all in its context. How will it show up on the site? There is no, &#8220;Oh, okay. There is something on the sidebar that&#8217;s interfering with my page.&#8221; And it&#8217;s the same thing that we talked about before where as long as you see the full context of your page, all the worry goes away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister:</em> I love what you said as well about having something in and then taking it away. I think that&#8217;s really, really important because sometimes when something&#8217;s completely new, it doesn&#8217;t work because it&#8217;s new, it&#8217;s not because it&#8217;s a bad idea and this is showing, it just needed to be delivered in a certain way. And I think not everything, but quite a few things that have been added a little bit recently are that. They are re-adding a slightly different variation once we&#8217;ve got things together. So sometimes you&#8217;ve got to find the combination of the puzzle to put these pieces in or the order to put them in. And this is exactly one of those, it needed to come in a certain order.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And I had some interesting conversations at WordCamp Europe. I had a lot of conversations at WordCamp Europe, but some of them were really interesting because I think if you&#8217;re not a developer, it&#8217;s really hard to understand that you have a vision for what people want to do. But unless you start programming and putting it in, you don&#8217;t know yet how it&#8217;s going, how it&#8217;s going to work. So let&#8217;s put it with the features in and then see what other people think about it and then reiterate on it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: It&#8217;s part of the freedom of creating in the open and part of what we&#8217;ve learned with this whole project is by creating in a plugin, we get to experiment. I want to use the word play because experiment sometimes feels a little bit harsh, it feels serious, but we get to play and see if this goes here, what did someone feel about it? This goes here. Testing things was really, really hard to do in core and it has been really, really hard. But by having it in this and been able to backtrack quicker, and that has been something that has happened time and time again of, &#8220;Oops, nope, let&#8217;s try this.&#8221; Or, &#8220;Okay, well this idea didn&#8217;t work this time.&#8221; We&#8217;ve still got it in the code base. It&#8217;s just back now. We haven&#8217;t completely lost it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In core, ideas go and get lost because it&#8217;s a big space, sadly. So having that flexibility, I think we are doing it a lot more as a project and having that healthier macro experimentation. But it&#8217;s seeing those mature ideas come. I love seeing things that was talked about, like you said footnotes, but things that were said years and years ago and it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Yay, they finally shipped.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And it&#8217;s not because they couldn&#8217;t ship it earlier. It&#8217;s also you didn&#8217;t know yet how other pieces that needed to fit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: It&#8217;s like baking a cake. It needs to be the right time and the right ingredients need to be available, and the right people to taste the cake. I don&#8217;t know, that metaphor went really weird, but right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Well, only chocolate lovers love chocolate cake, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: Yeah. And sometimes you are not delivering chocolate cake, you are delivering a Victorian sponge and to the wrong crowd. I don&#8217;t know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Those metaphors are really…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: It&#8217;s not working. Backtrack, what&#8217;s the next thing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Let&#8217;s try it again. We all have experiences, but it&#8217;s not in WordPress. So creating something really, really new in WordPress with a lot of backwards compatibility promises, it&#8217;s really hard.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: I always describe it as the difference between moving a little rowing boat to moving an ocean liner. One of them big Disney cruises or these giant things and then moving a little rowing boat. It is really easy, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: It&#8217;s not the same.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, yeah. But this editing piece, I think it&#8217;s really so much better now and I think it meets the vision now. So what&#8217;s also in the site editor bar is some template details. You might have already seen that, but now it also respects the settings and there is some language going on as well. Some language changes. You see the home template details, but that only tells you, okay, how many blog posts are on it? So it&#8217;s the blog home and not only just the homepage. So if you switch it to a static page, you will see that in the pages and not in the template pages. But it&#8217;s really good to have those template details in the site editor on the sidebar, it gives you a little bit more context.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: With components, I guess one of them to call out is the button has a size prop, which is a small little thing, but it&#8217;s maturity of the burn block, how many sites have burned every one of them? And having something like that is really big. It&#8217;s going back to one of my favorite topics of design systems. If we are building off core as a basis, you need to have these foundational things as part of it. So I&#8217;m really excited to see. Anytime I see that or any of the blocks getting different attributes, I am giddy with excitement about all those things. Basically because it means I can then use them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: You can use them, you can create styles with them. You can have different variations on the buttons and you don&#8217;t have to create a new block for the buttons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister:</em> Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Another block that got some nice features, an additional feature in there is the list block. It now has a different numbering type for the ordered list. So you could have alphabetical numbering or numbered numbering or Roman lit numbering and then capitals and then small cases. So now you have quite some options in there. I really like that. It&#8217;s catching up with other documentation or writing tools where you have that. But yeah, it&#8217;s good to have it in there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: And image block has as aspect ratio control. For some reason, I wanted to say radio control. That was exciting. I think that&#8217;s a whole different thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Multimedia, an image has radio.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: Which again is maturity, right? You mentioned parity with tools. It is, right? We need to have the best of these tools so that people use them natively. So that&#8217;s really what a lot of this is maturity of these tools, I think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And that was particularly important because you want your patterns when you switch out the images, you have them in a certain aspect ratio and when you switch them out and somebody puts in another image, you want it in the same aspect ratio and not blow up the whole pattern.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: Could ruin a party, that really can.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. I&#8217;m scrolling past it, but there is just stop to say that the interactivity API will not be in 6.3. It has been merged for the Gutenberg plugin, but it will only be available&#8230; they&#8217;re aiming for 6.4, which is not so far away, actually. September is the next beta. So it&#8217;s really going forward. There were some questions in the community about the interactivity API. A lot of people are very excited about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: We&#8217;re going to have some really nice toys for Christmas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And November 8th is I think the release of 6.4. So let&#8217;s get those toys wrapped up for Christmas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: That&#8217;s actually going to be some really interesting testing, I think. Some difference in testing because yes, we&#8217;ve done, but how you test some of that stuff is going to be a little bit different, I think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And we need a lot more examples.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: That&#8217;s where I&#8217;m going. How do you push some of that stuff?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And definitely there&#8217;s some documentation. I think they started with the documentation now. There were quite a few insights already in the make blog on core. I think two of them, and I can certainly add them to the show notes. So people who are all interested in that and want to help with the rollout, definitely can get a headstart on it, but not in 6.3.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: The next one, I&#8217;m going past so much, this is such a long list. It&#8217;s amazing. It is in the design tool section and that&#8217;s a sticky position. That&#8217;s not a phrase. Try re-enabling non-root sticky position. So actually, I think any improvements to things like this is really nice. The fact that we have this shows maturity of design tools. So I think that&#8217;s part of calling this out. Design tools as a whole are a concept that is still relatively new to us, but design tools means again, that people are going to build using it. And so I&#8217;m really excited anytime that any of our refinement happens to any of our design tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And I think in 6.2, the sticky position was already introduced for the header and the footer, but it was not for the sidebar because somehow it was really, really hard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: Sticky is hard. Sticky is hard to stick.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: You never get it to stick. And it needed to be a root wrapper or root block to make it sticky. You couldn&#8217;t do it in a column block where you have a sidebar and make that sticky.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: Because CSS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Because of CSS, yes. Yeah. So there is another attempt to make this work and needs definitely testing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister:</em> Yes, I was about to say that if anything needs testing, any time you see something listed in design tools, I would point anyone who is building themes or building anything to please test around those things because these are what really you will be building with. Having native sticky positions is much better than having to call on libraries or add things. And again, it means that people who want to build and create in the editor themselves have that capability to create some incredible, powerful, beautiful designs without having lack of access to them. It all sets us up to what amazing things could be done with the default themes, and that&#8217;s super exciting, what Christmas is going to bring there with all these tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So the next one is actually for media and we need to set this up a bit. So when you copy paste something from Google or from another website and there&#8217;s images in there, when you paste them into your canvas, the image will always go back to the original. So when the original site goes away, especially when you migrate from one domain to the other, the image goes away. And now there was a little button on every image where you could say and if it was allowed from the source site, that you could add that image to your library with a button. But of course when you have 15 images, it&#8217;s a little harder to do that. So now in the pre-publish screen, there is a section that suggests that you upload the external images and gives you a button and you can do it all at once. You also can click on the images and see how they show up in the post or in the page. So I think that&#8217;s a great addition to…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: Just what people expect. Again, and I do not belittle it by saying that. It&#8217;s more just, it just raises it up. It&#8217;s what people expect, it&#8217;s what people want. So it&#8217;s amazing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: It really raises the quality of the tools that you use, that it actually helps you also with the little things. Images are important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: Quality of life. Really, the release is quality of life and completion, which is a beautiful summer thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And refinement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: Yeah. So I think we&#8217;re going to talk maybe a little bit later about the command section, but we&#8217;re into commands.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: We&#8217;re good?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: Going down the list, there&#8217;s two things about the commands and that is add commands to templates, template parts and styles, and to related commands as well. I don&#8217;t know if you want to talk about commands right now or later?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit Pauli-Haack: We could. So we have a name now for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: We do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: In the development, it was always called the command center, but now it&#8217;s command palette and it tries to convey that&#8217;s the tool when you hit control K in the site editor, it gives you quick access to various commands, context-sensitive. And so you can say go to library or go to templates or go to template parts or delete template parts. All this you can do, and it&#8217;s also extensible. So you can create commands for your plugins, you can create commands for your themes as well. But the API is very, very new. So there are commands and with this release, there are commands with template, template parts, styles, how to manage the custom patterns, which custom patterns are the former reusable blocks. Sync patterns. So now you can say to your command palette, manage patterns or you also get UI commands for your post editor. So where you can say, add new post or something like that. So it&#8217;s not the center of it because it&#8217;s not a mission control palette or something like that. Or dashboard, it&#8217;s just you have a thought that you wanted…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: It&#8217;s your friendly helper there and there. And I think what these are doing is giving you examples. As you said, this is the start and it&#8217;s new. So by having these there, and this is just to start again, I think it&#8217;s worth of saying these are an example that someone could look at and be like, &#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s how you write one,&#8221; as well. So I am super curious to do that myself and be like, &#8220;Oh, okay, that&#8217;s how you write one. Okay.&#8221; And I am really excited to see what people create with this. Now we have decided the name, I was going to call it Bob, but it didn&#8217;t catch on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I always call him Fred.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: I call everyone Bob. No idea. Everyone picks a name that they call things repetitively, I think. And now that it has a name, which is amazing. And I think one of the good things is its translatable. And I think that was key in all of it. Personally, as long as it&#8217;s translatable, as long as we agree to something, we get it in, things can change. But let&#8217;s get it in and iterate. So these are great examples to then copy, rehash, and learn from. So I think 6.4, we&#8217;ll probably see more. And then I imagine there&#8217;s going to be a flowy of plugins, some nice little iterations and people exploring what it means to have these things as well. So it&#8217;s going to be very exciting to see what people create.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, I&#8217;m really happy about that. I would&#8217;ve never thought that my website tool would have these quick commands that I can just call up and then do stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: So the way that I think of it is a combination of&#8230; Because initially, I was Alfred was where my mind went because it&#8217;s searchy, I think of it now like Alfred. And if this, then that, and those two things combined is where I go because it is that, but it&#8217;s also workflow. So it&#8217;s that but in WordPress for me, and I am very excited about extending that and then where people take it, because people always take it in a way that you would never expect it to go. So I think the next year or so, we&#8217;re going to see some really exciting things come from that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, I totally agree with that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: New toys.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: New toys for everybody when the biggest toy is probably creating those commands and find, &#8220;Yeah, oh I can do this. It&#8217;s not that hard.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: And then even vigilant spaces to be able to create those commands ourselves. That becoming easier and easier I think is something that will happen over time as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, I totally get it. I want to get into programming so much and lock myself away for two weeks and do all this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: You don&#8217;t have to lock yourself away for it, but that&#8217;s all right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. So I&#8217;m scrolling and scrolling and scrolling. I don&#8217;t see anything anymore.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: So much. And I think that&#8217;s the thing. If we are going through the bug fixes and the enhancements and there&#8217;s just so much, I like the repetitive word flaky because when I see the fix flaky, that means that all the things which flaky is a bug report for, it kind of works and it kind of didn&#8217;t. I love that we&#8217;re down to that end of polishing, is my reflection on that. So I think that is really, really exciting that there&#8217;s so much polishing here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, and I think that was actually the outlook for 6.3, that most of the features get in and then we&#8217;re almost already…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: This is a giant section of those, which I love.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Are we done? I think we&#8217;re done. Oh yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: There are a lot of documentation fixes. Code quality fixes, code quality in block library, code quality in site editor. No, this is cool. Yes. Tooling. Yeah, the whole testing thing was kind of, whoa.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: That&#8217;s what you were talking about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: And I think that&#8217;s the thing that&#8217;s there. It&#8217;s probably testing coming in for command as well, but it&#8217;s all maturity of that. As I&#8217;m scrolling down, I&#8217;m seeing improving, improving, improving, improving.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. No, I think we made it. Yay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: Yay.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>WordPress 6.3 Beta</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. So we want to bring it back to the WordPress 6.3 beta and talk a little bit about what this means plus tickets for 6.3.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: I think one of the big things to think about is yes, there are things in now, but things that are in are going to have to respond to feedback. So whilst you might think, &#8220;Oh, that burden is perfectly placed,&#8221; I am really paraphrasing here, &#8220;That burden might not be perfectly placed.&#8221; So during beaters, you might see that burden moves because that burden needs to be in a better place. And there are a couple of tickets out there at the moment, which one of them particularly has things could be done in a better way. That&#8217;s where I&#8217;m going with this. So we are going to see that. We are going to see, &#8220;Oh dear, this breaks this under this circumstance when we actually tested it under this load or we tested it under this situation.&#8221; Because you can test under all the situations you think, but you don&#8217;t have that until you are real world testing or you&#8217;re testing. And as the betas get towards the higher numbers, we&#8217;re on two now. So we&#8217;re probably going to go at least four I would say, I don&#8217;t know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> I agree, I agree.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: I want to be optimistic. But realism kicks in here a little bit. You&#8217;re going to see fixes. So people need to bug report. People need to test or poke it, prod it, and use it. If you find something, see something, report something is the biggest thing because if you see something at release candidate, it&#8217;s a little bit late. It&#8217;s like shouting after the sheep have left the field. But if you say something now, it can be fixed. So if something doesn&#8217;t work with the plugin that is the only reason your client&#8217;s site works, now&#8217;s the reason to say basically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, definitely. And there will be. So I also wanted to caution some of the more eager WordPress news people or that want to grab screenshots and that kind of thing. There might be changes there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: Going back to my button moving.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: For instance, one change is from 6.0 to beta or to 16.2, so plugin releases 6.0 to 6.2, which will probably have some of the things that will get into 6.3 WordPress. But there was one menu item in the site editor on the bottom that was called library. And that has been renamed to patterns because that&#8217;s what&#8217;s in there. It&#8217;s the reusable block that are patterns now, template parts that are patterns now, and your custom patterns that are patterns now. And one was thinking about the library part for a long time because also there will be a fonts library, something like that. But then there were quite a few smart people who said, &#8220;Well, if I&#8217;m looking for fonts, I won&#8217;t go to library. I go to my styles and that&#8217;s a separate place.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So while we were using it, it was rethought what would make it a better idea or better metaphor for that. And pattern is something that&#8217;s WordPress branded and that a lot of people are really responding to. So library was not, it removes cognitive load when you have to think about, &#8220;I need to think of library.&#8221; When you see patterns, that&#8217;s where you want to go. So that&#8217;s just one example. There might be others. So when you do a screenshot for your video, make sure you have the latest beta or the latest…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: Really, screenshots is release candidate as much as it feels late, it&#8217;s not. There&#8217;s several weeks and that&#8217;s when you&#8217;ll find a lot of documentation takes it as well. I&#8217;ll working on the about page and we&#8217;re going to be doing the graphics around there as much as possible. But honestly, the final-final 01 PSD graphics&#8230; I don&#8217;t have to deal with PSDs, that&#8217;s when you take them because things rightly about translation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This language though, I think so many of these language refinements happening, whether you agree with it or not, because language is so subjective and everyone has feelings about Bob or Fred, what things should be called, is a sign of maturity of the product, is that we&#8217;re working our own language system and we&#8217;re saying these things are called this because it makes sense in our ecosystem. So I welcome that we&#8217;re finally clarifying some language and not just confusing everybody because it&#8217;s always been very confusing. We&#8217;re finally settling on some terms and we are then documenting what they are called because one of the problems we&#8217;ve always done is called something and then not written it down. So actually doing that is really helpful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Release candidate is scheduled for the 27th of July, so it&#8217;s another four weeks to go. So caution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: So you got to let the dust settle, you got to let stuff go. If everything is amazing and unicorns walk and everything, then nothing will change, but something&#8217;s going to change because humans in software.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, it&#8217;s going to change. And computers, right? Computers are involved, all bets are off, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: Yeah. And that&#8217;s okay, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: That&#8217;s totally okay. Just if you&#8217;re going on holiday, maybe have a friend do your screenshot for your blog post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: All right. So before we all come to an end, just a reminder, the two live Q&amp;As on July 6th and July 21st. Hit the registration button so we can all see you also on the live show and with some great demos. Before we end this show, do you have anything that you want to&#8230; How can people get in touch with you, Tammie?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: I&#8217;m karma Toast on all the things and I&#8217;m still around core, I&#8217;m around everywhere and I would love to speak to people. I will be at WordCamp U.S. as well if someone else is going. So I&#8217;d love to say hi, but reaching out, I&#8217;m always welcome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Awesome, awesome. Thank you so much for being on the show. And as always, dear listeners, the show notes will be published on gutenbergtimes.com/podcast.

Thank you so much for having me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Thank you so much, and you all have a good weekend and a good week and I&#8217;ll see you all or hear you all in the next two weeks. Take care, bye-bye.</p>\n\n\n\n<p> </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 01 Jul 2023 20:43:33 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:19:\"Gutenberg Changelog\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:24;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:92:\"WPTavern: WordPress Plugin Review Team Adds 6 New Sponsored Volunteers, Opens Applications \";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=146444\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:100:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-plugin-review-team-adds-6-new-sponsored-volunteers-opens-applications\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2286:\"<p>A new era has begun for WordPress.org&#8217;s Plugin Review Team. Mika Epstein, who has served for the past decade, is stepping down, but not before<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2023/06/29/plugin-review-team-update-the-next-phase-begins/\"> launching a new crew of volunteers</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team is responsible for approving newly submitted plugins, maintaining the Plugin Reviewer Handbook, as well as investigating any reported security issues and guideline violations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Historically, the Plugin Review team has had very little turnover, but a new crop of six sponsored volunteers will be contributing an estimated 50+ hours per week. The new members include <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/davidperez/\">David Pérez</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/eherman24/\">Evan Herman</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/frantorres/\">Francisco Torres</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/lukecarbis/\">Luke Carbis</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/martatorre/\">Marta Torre</a>, and <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/pacomarchante/\">Paco Marchante</a>. Their efforts are already in demand as they work to tackle a large backlog of plugins. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Given the nature of the work the team does, joining this team is a little different than some of the others: each new member will go through a vetting process by current team members before being selected,&#8221; Epstein said. &#8220;Some of the things the team is looking for are: a solid track record as a plugin developer; the ability to communicate clearly, kindly and constructively – both with other developers and users; interest in improving tools and processes; and excellent collaborative and conflict-management skills.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Epstein is encouraging more volunteers to apply, if they have at least five hours per week to devote to the team, as they could still use more help. Prospective team members can <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/handbook/apply/\">submit an application</a>, which will be evaluated by current team members. Applicants will be required to send examples of plugins they have coded to demonstrate their experience, provide references, and detail some of their contributions to the project.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 01 Jul 2023 02:52:15 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:25;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:105:\"Post Status: WordPress 6.3 Beta 2 • Help Test • WPDiversity • Plugin Team Next Phase • Mentorship\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=149753\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:100:\"https://poststatus.com/wordpress-6-3-beta-2-help-test-wpdiversity-plugin-team-next-phase-mentorship/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:21961:\"<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-this-week-at-wordpress-org-april-3-2023\">This Week at WordPress.org (June 26, 2023)</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"has-background has-theme-palette-8-background-color wp-block-post-excerpt\"><p class=\"wp-block-post-excerpt__excerpt\">Release season is upon us as we approach WordPress 6.3&#8217;s August 8th release.

Now as a project manager and social media content manager living in North Carolina, USA, she uses the software in her work and  in disability-advocacy.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The&nbsp;<em>People of WordPress</em>&nbsp;series shares inspiring stories of how people’s lives can change for the better through WordPress and its global community of contributors.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1024\" height=\"537\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/06/fi-allison-dye.jpg?resize=1024%2C537&ssl=1\" alt=\"Allison Dye\" class=\"wp-image-15292\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Allison was first introduced to WordPress when she was 13 years old. Her parents gave her own WordPress website to use, play, test, and try whatever she wanted with it. Her health issues had started when she was eight years old, and being able to express who she was and learn new skills provided an escape she needed. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">My first encounter with WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Allison said: &#8220;While the technical aspects of my new WordPress website intrigued me, I was more interested in the space it made for me to write. All throughout my childhood I had struggled with chronic pain, fatigue, and other unexplained symptoms. Having a private world I could call my own, I was able to write my story.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>&#8220;There is something truly amazing about having a place to tell your story.&#8221;</p>\n<cite>Allison Dye</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Her family faced many doctors, nurse, specialists and hospital visits, but could not get an answer to the difficulties faced by Allison. She said: &#8220;I felt like my life and world were out of control. But logging onto my little website and typing away on the computer keys gave me a sense of control. I couldn’t always do things that other kids had the energy to do. But I could get lost in writing for hours. I couldn’t control my life story, but I could write about it.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She felt it was like writing letters to her future self and would act as a reminder of how strong she had become. Even now when Allison writes on her website, she feels it is writing letters to her past self, expressing reassurance and pride. The practice of writing online continues to help her reflect on how she coped and made it through the difficulties.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">WordPress in the real world</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Allison hoped her early experiences with hospitals and being unwell was just part of being a child, and that in adulthood she would be healthy. She longed for this time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Growing up did not bring her this dream of a healthier life and an end to chronic pain. In fact, her condition worsened as she went through her teens and at 18 she finally received a diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/06/allison-2.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&ssl=1\" alt=\"Allison stood in front of trees\" class=\"wp-image-15290\" />Allison enjoying time with nature and trees\n\n\n\n<p>This changed what had been conventional job choices, as she was not able to handle a 9 to 5 work schedule. She could not drive herself to work on some days and relied on her mother to help with transport. She knew that she would have to find another way to work and she was determined to find it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She began writing music and book reviews online, and then moved onto writing blog posts. As they were published she started to receive payment and a sense of power over her life. She said: &#8220;WordPress felt familiar, typing on the computer keys felt comfortable, and sharing my words with the world felt surreal.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Allison&#8217;s sense of ownership of the software became part of her strength. &#8220;I think I believed WordPress was mine somehow. I was learning that WordPress is something that belongs to everyone in some way. And I loved it.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Finding work with WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The confidence using the platform gave Allison led her to find more about what it could do and meet other people who used it. She said: &#8220;The thing I love about WordPress is that it’s not just for developers or bloggers or SEO experts. I began to meet more people in the community and was delighted to find people like me, who didn’t know the technical stuff, but were a part of WordPress.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This global community orbiting around the software gave her an opportunity to meet social media managers, designers, and people from many different areas. She found that &#8216;there was a place for everyone&#8217;. The guiding strength and fascination Allison found and still finds today is in that community. Allison said: &#8220;The community felt as important as the rest of everything that makes WordPress what it is. It felt like it was about people and relationships as well as codes and databases.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2020, she was hired by a WordPress company. She said: &#8220;I like being a part of a WordPress company, and I love that I contribute to a team that helps people with their websites. I understand the importance of having a space that’s yours. Whether it’s a business or personal site, having a website gives you the power of telling your own story.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress gave Allison a freedom and an independence. She did not have to work a 9 to 5 job, rely on others to drive her on bad days with her MS, nor worry about days when she wanted to stay in her sweatshirts rather than go into an office to work. She said: &#8220;I have a 100% remote job which I can do despite the plot twists in my story, thanks to WordPress and the people in it.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress took Allison into the world of project management for a small agency, and this experience was to help guide her path, skills and confidence into the future. She went on to work in content management in WordPress, building pages for awareness campaigns for non profit organizations and small businesses as a contractor. She helps people update their websites, add and edit content, perform basic updates and help them to learn how to use their sites. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>&#8220;I tell all my clients to use WordPress because there is really no other solution that can scale as easily for growing organizations and small businesses. I love how WordPress allows them to tell their stories, share their passion, and have a place to call their own on the internet.&#8221;</p>\n<cite>Allison Dye</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>As a fluent English and Italian speaker, Allison is able to support clients in different countries from where she lives. &#8220;I love that with WordPress I&#8217;m able to support clients remotely. This is thanks to all of the many WordPress contributors, developers, project managers, content writers, and many, many volunteers that work tirelessly to enable people around the world to use WordPress.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Allison also became a certified as an English As A Second Language (ESL) teacher. &#8220;My affinity for words and languages allows me to teach passionately and creatively. I’m Italian-American and am fluent in English and Italian. Teaching English allows me to share my passion for communication with others.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Welcomed into the WordPress community</h2>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1024\" height=\"562\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/06/WPCoffeeTalk-Allie-Dye.png?resize=1024%2C562&ssl=1\" alt=\"Allie interviewed for a podcast on her use of WordPress\" class=\"wp-image-15293\" />Allie interviewed for a podcast on her use of WordPress\n\n\n\n<p>Allison attributes mentors and supporters in the WordPress community for helping her appreciate she really is part of it. Allison recalled: &#8220;It felt unreal. I wasn’t a dev, I don’t know how to code, and yet I got to be a part of it all? I felt like I was a fake. But Kimberly continues to remind me that I’m real, I get to be here, I get to stay, I have a place.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She was later encouraged to contribute by a WordPress community member to the Big Orange Heart, which aims to support and promote positive well-being and mental health within remote working communities. She said she felt &#8216;honored typing my words, pieces of my story, and sharing them with a community of people&#8217;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She also joined the <a href=\"https://us.wordcamp.org/2021/\">WordCamp US 2021</a> online organizing team. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Allison enjoys the fact that in the WordPress community, &#8216;everyone here is constantly working to be better and do better&#8217;.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Facing the future with strength from her friends and colleagues in WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"675\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/06/allison-1.jpg?resize=675%2C900&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-15289\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Allison was later diagnosed with two additional neurological conditions: Functional Neurological Disorder and Migraine. She said: &#8220;If it were not for WordPress I would really be unable to work. But WordPress and its community continue to be a part of my life and I am grateful to everyone who&#8217;s helped me along my way.

This September, on 14.-15., our community will return to the city where everything started.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Content has been planned with all skill levels, employment types and interests in mind. We do not discriminate, and WordPress users, developers, designers, people working in agencies or as a freelancer and other enthusiasts are all welcome, regardless of the experience level.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are more than thrilled about the upcoming lineup of talks and speakers. The best and most exciting part is that many of the topics do come outside of the WordPress world! WordCamp Finland will truly have educational, insightful and thought-provoking talks for everyone.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s a sneak peak of some of the topics:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Analytics in GDPR era</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Climate change and WordPress, things to consider</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Optimizing e-commerce</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Work fatigue, how to prevent it and cope from it</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Open source and WordPress communities, how do those benefit you?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Web Platform API’s and Gutenberg, modern Javascript development with WordPress</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Terminal and WP-CLI</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Designing more accessible websites and accessibility testing</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Achieving better and more inclusive web design, content and UX</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Security and hacked websites</li>\n\n\n\n<li>…and much more!</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://finland.wordcamp.org/2023/\">WordCamp Finland 2023</a> sessions will take place in Tampere on Friday 15. September. Most of the sessions will be held in English, although there are a handful of sessions held in Finnish as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The day before, on Thursday 14. September, a contributing evening will take place starting at 16:00. The contributing evening will feature workshops where you can contribute and learn about various WordPress-related topics in a hands-on setting. No coding skills required!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the whole event, there will also be ample time for networking and meeting other WordPress enthusiasts. Getting to meet and learn from other WordPress users face-to-face is one of the main reasons people attend WordCamps. In addition to learning from each other, attendees often make new friends and find employees/employers from the WordCamp crowd.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://finland.wordcamp.org/2023/tickets/\">Secure your tickets</a> now and ensure you’ll get to experience all of the insightful talks and activities with a welcoming community!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The full list of speakers, session descriptions and schedule will be published in early August, so make sure to follow us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wordcampfinland\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/WordCampFinland\">Facebook</a> and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/wordcamp-finland\">Linkedin</a> to get the latest updates.

WPScan recommends users disable the plugin until it has been adequately patched.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 30 Jun 2023 01:35:52 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:31;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:91:\"WordPress Foundation: 2023 Kim Parsell Memorial Scholarship Recipient: Yumi Nishioka (mimi)\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:41:\"https://wordpressfoundation.org/?p=569710\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:95:\"https://wordpressfoundation.org/news/2023/2023-kim-parsell-memorial-scholarship-recipient-mimi/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1692:\"<p><a href=\"https://us.wordcamp.org/2023/announcing-the-2023-kim-parsell-memorial-scholarship-winner-yumi-nishioka/\">This year’s Kim Parsell Memorial Scholarship recipient</a> is <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/mimitips/\">Yumi Nishioka (mimi)</a>. mimi is a passionate WordPress contributor who embodies the values that Kim would have appreciated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>mimi is a Web/UI Designer and Developer based in Tokyo, and has been a WordPress contributor since 2018.

The release leads opted to skip Beta 1, which was delayed yesterday after some technical issues with packaging the release, and have moved straight on to Beta 2. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As WordPress 6.3 is set to be the last major release of the Gutenberg project&#8217;s Phase 2 focus on customization, it ties up many loose ends related to the Site Editor and usability in general. It rolls in the ten most recent releases of the Gutenberg plugin &#8211; versions 15.2 through 16.1. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Major interface enhancements in this release, as outlined by the comprehensive <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/2023/06/27/help-test-wordpress-6-3/\">6.3 testing guide</a>, include the following: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/2023/06/27/help-test-wordpress-6-3/#command-palette\">Command Palette</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/2023/06/27/help-test-wordpress-6-3/#improved-page-management\">Improved Page Management</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/2023/06/27/help-test-wordpress-6-3/#content-editing-in-site-editor\">Content Editing in Site Editor</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/2023/06/27/help-test-wordpress-6-3/#distraction-free-mode-in-site-editor\">Distraction Free Mode in Site Editor</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/2023/06/27/help-test-wordpress-6-3/#block-theme-preview\">Block Theme Preview</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/2023/06/27/help-test-wordpress-6-3/#using-the-style-book-in-the-styles-site-view\">Using the Style Book in the Styles’ Site View</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/2023/06/27/help-test-wordpress-6-3/#styles-revisions\">Styles Revisions</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/2023/06/27/help-test-wordpress-6-3/#top-toolbar-improvements\">Top Toolbar Improvements</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Patterns are also getting a big boost in this release, as reusable blocks have been <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/reusable-blocks-renamed-to-patterns-with-synced-and-non-synced-options\">renamed to &#8220;synced patterns.&#8221;</a> Pattern creation is now available to users and a new pattern library will be located inside the editor for saving and managing both synced and unsynced patterns. Theme authors now have the capability to register custom patterns to templates, so they appear in the start modal to speed up page building.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.3 will introduce three new blocks, including <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/04/19/whats-new-in-gutenberg-15-6-19-april/#details-block-experimental\">details</a>, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/03/13/whats-new-in-gutenberg-15-3-13-march/#new-time-to-read-block\">time-to-read</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/49797\">footnotes</a>, along with many improvements to existing blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This release comes with significant performance updates, most notably the addition of <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/12009\">defer and async support to the WP Scripts API</a> and <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/58235\">fetchpriority support for images</a>. Support for PHP versions 8.0+ has been improved, along with block template resolution, image lazy loading, and the emoji loader. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the rare event that the manual update of a theme or plugin fails, <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/51857\">auto-rollback</a> is available as of WordPress 6.3.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beta 2 testers are encouraged to <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/newticket\">file bug reports on WordPress Trac</a>. During beta testing until the last RC, the WordPress project will also be <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/security/2023/06/28/doubling-the-bounties-for-wordpress-6-3-beta/\">doubling its monetary reward</a> for any new, unreleased security issues that are uncovered.

My name is Nathan Wrigley. Jukebox is a podcast, which is dedicated to all things WordPress. The people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case how AI and WordPress can work together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for.

And you can copy that URL into most podcast players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature on the podcast, I&#8217;m keen to hear from you. And hopefully get you or your idea featured on the show. Head to WPTavern.com forward slash contact forward slash jukebox, and use the form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today, we have James Dominy. James is a computer scientist with a master&#8217;s degree in bioinformatics. He lives in Ireland working at the WP engine Limerick office.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the second podcast recorded at WordCamp Europe, 2023 in Athens. James gave a talk at the event about the influence of AI on the WordPress community and how it&#8217;s going to disrupt so many of the roles which WordPressers currently occupy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We talk about the recent rise of ChatGPT, and the fact that it&#8217;s made AI available to almost anyone. In less than 12 months, many of us have gone from never touching AI technologies to using them on a daily basis to speed up some aspect of our work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The discussion moves on to the rate at which AI systems might evolve, and whether or not they&#8217;re truly intelligent or just a suite of technologies which masquerade is intelligent. Are they merely good at predicting the next word or phrase in any given sentence? Is there a scenario in which we can expect our machines to stop simply regurgitating texts and images based upon what they&#8217;ve consumed; a future in which they can set their own agendas and learn based upon their own goals?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This gets into the subject of whether or not AI is in any meaningful way innately intelligent, or just good at making us think that it is, and whether or not the famous Turing test is a worthwhile measure of the abilities of an AI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>James&#8217; his background in biochemistry comes in handy as we turn our attention to whether or not there&#8217;s something unique about the brains that we all possess. Or if intelligence is merely a matter of the amount of compute power that an AI can consume. It&#8217;s more or less certain that given time machines will be more capable than they are now. So when if ever does the intelligence Rubicon get crossed?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The current AI systems can be broadly classified as Large Language Models or LLMs for short, and James explains what these are and how they work. How can they create a sentence word by word if they don&#8217;t have an understanding of where each sentence is going to end up?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>James explains that LLMs are a little more complex than just handling one word at a time, always moving backwards and forwards within their predictions to ensure that they&#8217;re creating content which makes sense, even if it&#8217;s not always factually accurate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We then move on from the conceptual understanding of AI to more concrete ways it can be implemented. What ways can WordPress users implement AI right now? And what innovations might we reasonably expect to be available in the future? Will we be able to get AI to make intelligent decisions about our websites SEO or design, and therefore be able to focus our time on other more pressing matters?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a fascinating conversation, whether or not you&#8217;ve used AI tools in the past.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more, you can find all the links in the show notes by heading to WPTavern.com forward slash podcast. Where you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so without further delay, I bring you James Dominy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast today by James Dominy. How are you doing James?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:51] <strong>James Dominy:</strong> I&#8217;m well, thanks. Hi Nathan. How are you doing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:53] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, good, thanks. We&#8217;re at WordCamp Europe. We&#8217;re upstairs somewhere. I&#8217;m not entirely sure where we are in all honesty. The principle idea of today&#8217;s conversation with James is he&#8217;s done a presentation at WordCamp Europe all about AI. Now, I literally can&#8217;t think of a topic which is getting more interest at the moment. It seems the general press is talking about AI all the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:17] <strong>James Dominy:</strong> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:17] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It&#8217;s consuming absolutely everything. So it&#8217;s the perfect time to have this conversation. What was your talk about today? What did you actually talk about in front of those people?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:24] <strong>James Dominy:</strong> Right. So my talk was about the influence of AI on the WordPress community. The WordPress community involving, in my mind, roughly three groups. You&#8217;ve got your freelancer, single content generator, blogger. You have someone who does the same job but in a business as in an agency or a marketing or a brand context. And then on the other side, you&#8217;ve got software developers who are developing plugins or working on the actual WordPress Core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And AI is going to be changing the way all of those people work. Mostly I focused on the first and the third groups. I don&#8217;t know enough about the business aspects to really talk about the agency and the marketing side of things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I personally, I&#8217;m a software developer, so I suppose I really skewed towards that in the end. But, my wife has been a WordPresser for 15, 20 years, which is how I ended up doing this. And a lot of the things that she&#8217;s been using ChatGPT quite actively recently.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And she&#8217;s been chatting to me after work going, you know, I was trying to use ChatGPT to do X Y Z. And I thought, well, you know, that&#8217;s interesting. I know some bit about machine learning and the way these things work. I&#8217;ve read some stuff on the internals and I have opinions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:33] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Perfect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:34] <strong>James Dominy:</strong> So that&#8217;s how I got here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:35] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. Well, that&#8217;s perfect. Thank you. It seems like at the moment the word ChatGPT could be easily interchanged with AI . Everybody is using that as the pseudonym for AI and it&#8217;s not really, is it? It really is a much bigger subject. But that is, it feels at the moment, the most useful implementation in the WordPress space. You know, you lock it into the block editor in some way shape and you create some content in that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:00] <strong>James Dominy:</strong> And I mean, I am absolutely guilty of that. I think the number of times I&#8217;ve said ChatGPT, I mean AI generative systems, or something during my workshop this morning is well beyond count.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>it is likely to fall victim of a trademark thing at some point. Like Google desperately tries to claim that Google is a trademark and shouldn&#8217;t be used as a generic term for search. I expect the same thing will happen with ChatGPT at some point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:25] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> This is going to sound a little bit, well, maybe snarky is the wrong word, but I hope you don&#8217;t take it this way, but it feels to me that the pace of change in AI is so remarkably rapid. I mean, like nothing I can think of. So, is there a way that we can even know what AI could look like in a year&#8217;s time, two years&#8217; time, five years&#8217; time? So in other words, if we speculate on what it could be to WordPress, is that a serious enterprise? Is it serious endeavor? Or are we just hoping that we get the right guess? Because I don&#8217;t know what it&#8217;s going to be like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:59] <strong>James Dominy:</strong> I think if we rephrase the question a bit, we might get a better answer. So AIs are human design systems. And there is a thing called the alignment problem where there is an element of design to AIs, and we give it a direction, but it doesn&#8217;t always go the direction we want and I think that is the unanswerable part of this question.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, there are going to be emergent surprises from the capabilities of AIs. But for the most part, AIs are developed with a specific goal in mind. Large language models were developed, okay I&#8217;m taking a wild educated guess here perhaps, but they were developed with the idea of producing text that sounded like a human. And I mean, we&#8217;ve had the Turing test for nearly a hundred years, more than a hundred years? 21, yeah, more than a hundred years now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I mean, that&#8217;s been a goal for a hundred years. Everyone says that AI has advanced rapidly and it has, but the core mathematical principles that are involved, those haven&#8217;t advanced. I don&#8217;t want to take away from the people who&#8217;ve done the work here. There has been work that&#8217;s been put into it, but I think what&#8217;s really given us the quantum leap here is the amount of computational power that we can throw at the problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as long as that is increasing exponentially, I think we can expect that the models themselves will get exponentially better at roughly the same rate as the amount of hardware we throw at it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:28] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So we can stare into the future and imagine that it&#8217;s going to get exponentially, logarithmically it&#8217;s going to, it&#8217;s just going to get better and better and better. But we can&#8217;t predict the ways that it might output that betterness. Who knows what kind of interface there&#8217;ll be, or.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:41] <strong>James Dominy:</strong> Yeah. I think better&#8217;s a very evasive term perhaps, on my part. I think there are specific ways that it is going to get better. For example, we are going to see less confused AIs, because they are able to process more tokens. They have deeper models. Deeper statistical trees for outputs. They&#8217;re able to take more context in and apply it to whatever comes out. So in that sense we&#8217;re going to see a better output from an AI. Is it going to ever be able to innovate? Ooh, that&#8217;s a deep philosophical question, and I mean we can get into that, but I don&#8217;t know that we have time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:20] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I think I would like to get into that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:22] <strong>James Dominy:</strong> Okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:22] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Because when we begin talking about AI, I think the word which sticks is intelligence. The artificial bit gets quickly forgotten and we imagine that there is some kind of intelligence behind this, because we ask it a fairly straightforward, or even indeed quite complicated question.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we get something which appears to pass the Turing test. Just for those people who are listening, the Turing test is a fairly blunt measure of whether you are talking to something which is a human or not human, masquerading as a human. And if something is deemed to have passed the Turing test, it&#8217;s indistinguishable from a human.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, I have an intuition that really what we&#8217;re getting back, it&#8217;s not intelligent in any meaningful sense of the word. It&#8217;s kind of like a regurgitation machine. It&#8217;s sucking in information and then it&#8217;s just giving us a best approximation of what it thinks we want to hear. But it&#8217;s not truly intelligent. If you asked it something utterly tangential, that it had no capacity, it had no data storage on, it would be unable to cope with that, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:22] <strong>James Dominy:</strong> I think yes. If you can clearly delineate the idea of, we have no data on this, which is very difficult considering the amounts of information that, you know, give something access to Wikipedia and that AI generative system might well be able to produce an opinion on practically anything these days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if it hasn&#8217;t read the latest paper on advanced quantum mechanic theory, it&#8217;s not going to know it. That text isn&#8217;t going to be there. Could it reproduce that paper? That&#8217;s a subtely different question, because then it comes down to, well, when a human produces that paper, what are they really doing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They&#8217;re synthesizing their knowledge from a bunch of different things that they&#8217;ve learned, and they&#8217;re producing text in a language, in a grammar, that they have learned in a very similar way, that statistically speaking this sentence follows this grammatical form. Because I have learned that as a child through hearing it several thousand times from the people around me and my parents. What&#8217;s different?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A more practical example here, I was having this discussion earlier today, and someone said yes, but they&#8217;re not truly intelligent. But if you consider it, even now, we can ask Chat GPT something, and I&#8217;m going to be abstract cause I don&#8217;t have a concrete example here, I&#8217;m sorry. But we can say to ChatGPT, I want you to produce a poem in the style of Shakespeare, a sonnet or something. But I want you to use a plot from Goethe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, fine. Now it can do that. It can give you a response. I&#8217;m not sure that it&#8217;ll be a good response. I haven&#8217;t tried that particular one. But in that context, if you are asking a human to do that, and we automatically make the assumption of other human beings that they understand. And, sorry, I&#8217;m making air quotes here. That they understand, in quotes, who Goethe is. That that is a person and a character. That Goethe has a particular style and a proclivity for a certain pattern in his plots.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that those are all, to use a computer science term, symbolic representations. Abstract concepts. So is ChatGPT actually understanding those abstract concepts? Does it understand that Goethe is a person? Educated guests here, probably not. But it does understand that Goethe refers to a certain, can draw a line in all the stuff that it has learned and know this is Goethe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It has a concept of what it thinks Goethe is. Then from there it can say, and he has done work on the following things, and these are plots. And so it kind of understands. There&#8217;s another line there about what a plot is, which is a very abstract concept.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Does that mean it&#8217;s intelligent? Does that mean it understands? I don&#8217;t know. That&#8217;s my answer because I did biochemistry at university, and there&#8217;s also the question there, and it&#8217;s exactly the same question. It&#8217;s at what point do the biological machines, the biochemical machines, your actual proteins and things that are obviously on their own, unintelligent, and yet when they act in concerts, they produce a cell, and a living being.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where does that boundary exist? Is it gray? Is it a hard line? And the same for me is true of the intelligence question here. Intelligence is a, it&#8217;s an aglomeration of lots of small, well-defined things that when they start interacting, become more than the sum of their parts. Does it come down to the Turing test? I mean, the fact that people on support, little support popups on the web, have to ask, are you a human every now and then. It immediately says, we have AIs that have passed the Turing test long ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But here in this case, like the extended Turing test is the thing actually intelligent? I don&#8217;t know. I genuinely don&#8217;t know the answer there. In some sense, yes, because it&#8217;s doing almost the same thing as we are, just in a different, with different delineations and different abstractions, but the process is probably the same.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:33] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Given that you&#8217;ve got a background in, forgive me, did you say biochemistry?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:37] <strong>James Dominy:</strong> Yeah, biochemistry and computer science, bioinfomatics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:39] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, do you have an intuition as to whether the substrate of the brain has some unique capacity that can lock intelligence into it? In other words, is there a point at which a computer cannot leap the hurdle? There&#8217;s something special about the brain, the way the brain is created? This piece of wetwear in our head.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:00] <strong>James Dominy:</strong> Unpopular opinion, I think it comes down to brute force count. We&#8217;ve got trillions of cells. Large language models, I don&#8217;t know what the numbers are for GPT4, but we&#8217;re not at trillions yet. Maybe when we get there, I don&#8217;t know where the tipping point is, you know. Maybe when we get to tens of billions, or whatever number it happens to be, is the point where this thing actually becomes intelligent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we would be unable to distinguish them from a human, other than the fact that we&#8217;re looking at a screen that, that we know it&#8217;s running on the chip in front of us. But if it&#8217;s over the internet and it&#8217;s on a machine running, or whether we&#8217;re talking to a person in the support center. Or we are at the McDonald&#8217;s kiosk of 2050 and being asked whether we want fries with that. If we can&#8217;t see the person who&#8217;s asking the question, if we&#8217;re at the drive-through, we can&#8217;t see the person. Do we care?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:54] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Interesting. You mentioned a couple of times large language models, often abbreviated just to LLM. My understanding at least, forgive me I&#8217;m, I really genuinely am no expert about this. This is the underpinning of how it works. I&#8217;m going to explain it in crude terms, and then I&#8217;m hoping you&#8217;ll step in and pad it out and make it more accurate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:12] <strong>James Dominy:</strong> I should caveat anything that I say here with I also am not an expert on these, but I will do what I can.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:17] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So a large language model, my understanding is that things like ChatGPT are built on top of this, and essentially it is vacuuming up the internet. Text, images, whatever data you can throw at it. And it&#8217;s consuming that, storing that. And then at the point where you ask it something, so write a sonnet in the style of Goethe, written by Shakespeare. It&#8217;s then making a best approximation, and it&#8217;s going through a process of, okay, what should the first word be? Right, we&#8217;ve decided on that. Now, let&#8217;s figure out the second word, and the third word and the fourth word. Until finally it ends in a full stop and it&#8217;s done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s the process it&#8217;s going through. Which seems highly unintelligent. But then again, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m doing now. I&#8217;m probably selecting in some way what the next word is and what the next word is. But yeah, explain to us how these large language models work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:03] <strong>James Dominy:</strong> I think that&#8217;s a pretty fair summation. I think the important bit that needs to be filled in there is that what we perceive and use as customers of AI systems in general is a layer of several different models. There is a lot of pre-processing that goes into our prompts and post-processing in terms of what comes out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But fundamentally the large language model is, yes, it&#8217;s strings of text generally. There are different systems that the AI images, image systems, are a different form of maths. Most of them, at least the ones that I know of, are mostly based on something called Stable Diffusion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can chat about that separately, but large language models tend to be trained on a large pile of text where they develop statistical inferences for the likelihood of some sequence of words following some other sequence of words. So as you say, like, if I know that a pile of words were written by Goethe, then I can sub select that aspect of my trained data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m personifying an AI here already. The AI can circumscribe, isolate a portion of its training set, and say, okay I will use this subset of my training, and use the statistical values for what words follow what other words that Goethe wrote. And then you will get something in the style of Goethe out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:29] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It&#8217;s kind of astonishing that that works at all. That one word follows another in something which comes out as a sentence because, I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ve ever tried that experiment on your phone where you begin the predictive text. On my phone there&#8217;s there&#8217;s usually three words above the little typewriter, and it tries to say what the next word is based upon the previous word.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:49] <strong>James Dominy:</strong> It&#8217;s not called auto corrupt for nothing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:50] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, so you just click them at the end of that process, you have fantastic gibberish. It&#8217;s usually quite entertaining, and yet this system is able to, in some way just hijack that whole process and make it so that by the end the whole thing makes sense in isolation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is Goethe. It looks like Shakespeare, sounds like Shakespeare, could easily be Shakespeare. How is it predicting into the future such that by the end, the whole thing makes sense? Is there more processing going on than, okay, just the next word. Is it reading backwards?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:22] <strong>James Dominy:</strong> Yes absolutely. Again, not an expert on LLMs, but there is this thing called a Markov Model. Which is a much more linear chain. It&#8217;s used often for bioinformatics, for genome and predicting the most likely next amino acid or nucleic acid in a genomic or a proteomic sequence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so Markov Models are very simple. They have a depth and that is how much history they remember of what they&#8217;ve seen. So you point a Markov Model at the beginning of the sequence of letters of nucleic, the ACGT&#8217;s. And then you want to say, okay, I&#8217;ve managed to sequence this off my organism. I&#8217;ve got a hundred bases and I want to know what the most likely one after that is, because that&#8217;s where it got cut off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You give it a hundred, maybe you have a buffer of 10. So it remembers the last ten. It sort of slides this window of visibility over the whole sequence and mathematically starts working out, you know, what comes after an A? Okay, 30% of the time it&#8217;s a C. 50% of the time it&#8217;s a G. And by the end of it, it can with reasonable accuracy to some value of how much information you&#8217;ve given it, predict okay, in this particular portion of 10 that I&#8217;ve seen, the next one should be T.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And they get better as you give them more and more information. As you give them a bigger and bigger window. As you let them consume more and more memory whilst they&#8217;re doing their job, their accuracy increases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I imagine the same is true of large language models, because they do. They don&#8217;t just predict the next word, they operate on phrases, on whole sentences. At some point, maybe they already do, but I imagine they operate on whole paragraphs. And again, it depends on what you&#8217;re trying to produce. Like if you&#8217;re trying to produce a legal contract that&#8217;s got a fairly prescribed grammar and form to it. And you know, then like statistically you&#8217;re going to produce the same paragraph over and over again because you want the same effect out of contracts you do all the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:22] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You described this slider. That really got to the nub of it. I genuinely didn&#8217;t realize that it wasn&#8217;t doing any more than just predicting the next word. And because that&#8217;s the way I thought about it, I thought it was literally astonishing that it could throw together a sentence based upon just the next word, if it didn&#8217;t know what two words previously it had written.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s back to my predictive text, which produces pure gobbledygook. But it still, occasionally, it goes down a blind alley, doesn&#8217;t it? Because although that is, presumably 99 times out of a hundred that will lead to a cogent sentence, which is readable. Occasionally it does this thing, which I think has got the name hallucinate, where it just gets slightly derailed and goes off in a different direction. And so produces something which is, I don&#8217;t know, inaccurate, just nonsense.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:06] <strong>James Dominy:</strong> Yes. Well known for being confidently wrong for sure. I&#8217;ve experienced something similar, and I find that it is especially the case where you switch contexts. Like when you are asking it to do more than one thing at a time, and you make a change to the first thing that you expect to carry over into the context of the second task, and it just doesn&#8217;t. It gets confused.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the two things, this is especially true in coding, where you ask it to produce one piece of code and a function here, and another piece of code and a function on the other side. And you expect them, those two functions to interoperate correctly. Which means that you have to get the convention, the interface between those two things, the same on both sides.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if you say, actually, I want this to be called Bob, that doesn&#8217;t necessarily translate. Again, I suppose this is my intuition. There are a lot of ways that that failure can happen. The most obvious one is that you&#8217;re doing too much and it&#8217;s run out of tokens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tokens are sort of an abstraction. Sorry I used that word a lot. Computer scientist. Tokens are, they&#8217;re not strictly speaking individual words, but they are a rough approximation of a unit of knowledge, context. I don&#8217;t know what the right word here. They chose token, right? So, if you use the API for ChatGPT, one of the things that you pass is how many tokens is the call allowed to use?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because you are charged by tokens. And if you say only 30 tokens, you get worse answers than if you give it an allowance of a hundred tokens. Meaning that you might have given it a problem that exceeds the window that I was describing earlier. That sort of backtrack of context that it&#8217;s allowed to use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or you give it to two contexts and together they just go over and then it&#8217;s confused because it doesn&#8217;t know which, again, I say this as a semi-educated guess. We as humans don&#8217;t have a good definition of what context means in this conversation. How do we expect a computer system to?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:05] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Just as you&#8217;ve been talking, in my head, I&#8217;ve come up with this analogy of what I now think AI represents to me, and it represents essentially a very, very clever baby. There&#8217;s this child crawling around on the ground, I really do mean an infant who you fully forgive for knocking everything over and, tipping things over, damaging things and what have you. And yet this child can speak. So on the one hand, it can talk to you, but it&#8217;s just making utterly horrific mistakes because it&#8217;s a baby and you forgive it for that. So I don&#8217;t know how that sits, but that&#8217;s what&#8217;s it landed in my head.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:40] <strong>James Dominy:</strong> I wouldn&#8217;t say that AI is in its infancy anymore, but it&#8217;s probably in its toddler year, and maybe we need to watch out when it turns two.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:47] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So we&#8217;ve, done the sort of high level what is AI and all of that. That&#8217;s fascinating. But given that this is a WordPress event and it&#8217;s a WordPress podcast, let&#8217;s bind some of this stuff to the product itself. So WordPress largely is a content creation platform. You open it up, you make a post, you make a page, and typically into that goes text, sometimes images, sometimes video, possibly some other file formats. But let&#8217;s stick with the model of text and images. Why do we want, or how could we put AI into WordPress? What are the things that might be desirable in a WordPress site that AI could assist us with?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:21] <strong>James Dominy:</strong> I am totally going to be stealing some ideas from the AI content creation things that have happened this morning. I mean, there&#8217;s the obvious answer. I need to generate a thousand words for my editor by 4:00 PM today. Hey, ChatGPT, can you generate a thousand words on topic, blah?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think there are a lot of other places. I&#8217;d be super surprised if this hasn&#8217;t actually happened already. But, hey ChatGPT, write me an article that gets me to the top five Google ranking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other obvious place for me as a software developer is using it to develop code. Humans are inventive. We&#8217;re going to see a lot of uses for AI that we never thought of. That&#8217;s not a bad thing at all. The more ways that we can use AI, I think the better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, there are questions about the dangers, and I&#8217;m sure that&#8217;s a question coming up later on, so I won&#8217;t dive into them now, but in the WordPress community, there&#8217;s content creation, but there&#8217;s also content moderation, where AI can probably help a lot. Analyze this piece of text to me and tell me is it spam? Does it contain harmful or hateful content?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, it&#8217;s a case of you get what you give. There&#8217;s that story about Microsoft, I think it was Microsoft, and the chatbot that turned into a horrible Nazi racist within about two hours, having been trained on Twitter data. We need to be careful about that, certainly. I&#8217;m struggling to think of things beyond the obvious.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:47] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Well, I think probably it is going to be the obvious, isn&#8217;t it? Largely, people are popping in text and so having something which will allow you within the interface, whether you are in a page builder or whether you&#8217;re using the Gutenberg editor, the ability to interrupt that flow and say, okay, I&#8217;ve written enough now, ChatGPT, take over. Give me the next 300 words please. Or just read what I&#8217;ve written and can you just finish this? I&#8217;m almost there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:11] <strong>James Dominy:</strong> Yeah, we are doing it already, even if it&#8217;s a sort of fairly primitive flow now where we write some stuff in our block editor, copy it up, pop it in ChatGPT or Bard or whatever, and say, hey, this is too formal. Or this is not formal enough. And it&#8217;s really great at that. Make this sound more businessy. And it understands the word businessy. The tool integration, it&#8217;s obvious in a lot of ways, but I think there are going to be a lot of non-obvious integrations. Like, oh wow, I wish I thought of that, and, you know, made my millions off that product. I mean, Jetpack is doing it already, you know. I am able to actively engage with ChatGPT whilst I&#8217;m editing my blog post. Fantastic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another thing that I&#8217;ve just thought of is oh, I run a WooCommerce site and I want to use, not necessarily ChatGPT, but some other AI system to analyze product sales and use that to promote, to change the listing on my product site, so that I can sell more product. That&#8217;s going to happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:09] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, given that it&#8217;s incredibly good at consuming data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:13] <strong>James Dominy:</strong> Yeah, or even generating it on the fly. Generate 300 different descriptions of this product and randomize them. Put them out there and see which one sells best. We are doing that manually already. It&#8217;s AB testing at a larger scale.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:28] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. You can imagine a situation where the AI runs the split test, but it&#8217;s divided over 300 variations. And it decides for itself which is the winner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:39] <strong>James Dominy:</strong> On a day-to-day basis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:40] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> On an hourly basis. Implements the winner and then begins the whole process over and over again. I also wonder if in WordPress there is going to be AI to help lay out things. So at the moment we have the block editor. It enables you to create fairly complex layouts. We also have page builders, which allow us to do the same thing. So it alludes to what I was speaking about a moment ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Talking, so literally talking, as well as typing in. I would like a homepage. I would like that homepage to show off my plumbing business, and here&#8217;s my telephone number. I&#8217;d like to have a picture of me, or somebody doing some plumbing, some additional content down there. You get the picture?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:17] <strong>James Dominy:</strong> Yeah, absolutely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:18] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> A few little prompts, and rather than spitting out text or an image, whole layouts come out. And we can pick from 300 different layouts. I&#8217;ll go for that one, but now make the buttons red. The AI takes over the design process in a way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:32] <strong>James Dominy:</strong> Yeah. I&#8217;m going to confess here that I&#8217;m absolutely stealing this opinion from the AI panel earlier. I think the danger for WordPress specifically there, is that that level of automation for us with human engagement and, you know, developing something through conversation with an AI, might actually skip WordPress entirely. Why must the AI choose WordPress to do this?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe if we as a WordPress community invest in making WordPress AI integrated, then yeah, absolutely. Then hopefully we&#8217;re first to market with that in a way. And then it will generate stuff in WordPress. But there&#8217;s no, there&#8217;s no reason for it to maybe choose a Wix page as a better solution for you as a plumber, who doesn&#8217;t update things very often. You just want a static, you know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chances are it&#8217;ll just say, here is some HTML it does the job for you, it&#8217;s pretty. I made some images for you as well. And, all you need to do is run the sequence of commands to, SSH it up to provider of your choice. Or I have selected this provider because I know how much they all charge and this is the cheapest. Or you&#8217;ve asked for the fastest, whatever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:41] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Oh, interesting, okay. So it&#8217;s not just bound inside the WordPress interface. Literally, put this in the cheapest place as of today. And then if it changes in the next 24 hours, just move it over there and change the DNS for me and.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:53] <strong>James Dominy:</strong> One day. For sure. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:54] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay. So that very nicely ties into the harms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:58] <strong>James Dominy:</strong> There it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:58] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> What we&#8217;ve just laid out is potentially quite harmful to a lot of the jobs that people do inside of WordPress. We&#8217;ve just described a workflow in which many of the things that we would charge clients for, which we could potentially get AI to do. Whether that&#8217;s a voice interface or a visual interface or a type, we&#8217;re typing in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that is concerning, if we are giving AI the option to put us out of work. And I know at the moment, this is the hot topic. I&#8217;m pretty sure that there&#8217;s some fairly large organizations who have begun this process already. They&#8217;ve taken some staff who are doing jobs which can be swapped out for AI, and they&#8217;ve shed those staff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And whilst we&#8217;re in the beginning phase of that, it seems like we can swallow so much of people getting laid off. The problem, potentially is, if we keep laying people off over and over and over again and we give everything over to the AI, we suddenly are in a position where, well, there&#8217;s no humans in this whole process anymore. Does any of that give you pause for thought?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:53] <strong>James Dominy:</strong> Yeah, it certainly does. I think we should temper our expectations of the capabilities of AI. So there&#8217;s a technical term called a terminal goal. The delineation between specific artificial intelligences and machine learning, in that world, and the concept of the general artificial intelligences, which is what everyone thinks of when they think of the I in artificial intelligence, is an AI that is capable of forming its own terminal goals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Its own, don&#8217;t get me wrong, like we have AIs that are capable of forming what are called intermediate nodes. If you tell an AI of a particular type to go and do a particular thing, then it is capable of forming intermediate steps. In order to do the thing you&#8217;ve told me, I need to first do this, which requires me to do that. And, you know, it forms a chain of goals, but none of those goals are emergent from the AI. They are towards a goal we have given the AI externally.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That ability to form a goal internally is the concept of a terminal goal. And we don&#8217;t have, large language models don&#8217;t have terminal goals. Large language models, stable diffusion, all of the different algorithms that are hot topics today, are all couched within the idea of solving a problem given to them as an input.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which means there&#8217;s always going to need to be a human. At least with what we&#8217;ve got now. No matter how good these models get, how much brain power we give them. And this maybe is going against what I said earlier of like, I think it&#8217;s probably a quantity thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe there&#8217;s a tipping point. Maybe there&#8217;s a tipping point where the intermediate goal that it forms is indistinguishable from a terminal goal in a human brain. But for the moment, I think there always needs to be a human there to give the AI the task to solve. Open AI isn&#8217;t just running servers randomly just doing stuff. It spends its computational time answering users prompts and questions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:48] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So if we pursue artificial intelligence research, and the end goal is to create an AGI, then presumably at some point we&#8217;ve got something which is indistinguishable from a human because it can set its own goals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:02] <strong>James Dominy:</strong> The cyberpunk dystopia, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:03] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> But we&#8217;re not there yet. This is a ways off, my understanding at least anyway. But in the more short term, let&#8217;s bind it to the loss of jobs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:11] <strong>James Dominy:</strong> In my workshop this morning, I think the primary point that I wanted to get across is, if you are currently in the WordPress community, employed and or making an income out of WordPress. ChatGPT, Bard, generative AI, large language models are a tool that you should be learning to use. They&#8217;re not going to replace you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe that&#8217;s less true on the content generation side, because large language models are particularly good at that. But there&#8217;s a flip side to that because on the software development side, programming languages have very strict grammars, which means the statistical model is particularly good at producing output for programming languages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s not good at handling the large amounts of complexity that can exist in large pieces of code. But equally so, I mean, if you ask it to give you a hundred items of things to do in Athens, whilst I&#8217;m totally, totally, working hard at a conference, uh, then you are probably going to get repeats. You might run into the confusion problem, the hallucination issue at some point there, where just a hundred is too much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nobody has ever written an article of a hundred things to do in Athens in a day. I don&#8217;t know, I haven&#8217;t tried that. I&#8217;m guessing that there are going to be limitations. So some jobs are more in threat than others, but I think that if you&#8217;re already in the industry, or in the community and working with it, go with it and, absorb the tools into your day-to-day flow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s going to make you better at what you do. Faster at what you do. Hopefully able to make more money. Hopefully able to communicate with more people, translations et cetera. Make your blog multilingual. There are a lot of things that you can use it for that aren&#8217;t immediately coming after your job.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem for me, and this again is the point that I was trying to get across in the workshop, the problem is the next generation. The people who are getting into WordPress today and tomorrow, and in six months time. Who are coming into a world where AI is already in such usage that it&#8217;s solving the simple problems. And the same as true, my editor wants 200 words or whatever on fun things to do in Athens overnight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, great. ChatGPT can do that for the editor. Why does he need a junior content writer anymore? But the problem is, I mean, we&#8217;ve already said, sometimes it&#8217;s spectacularly wrong. Does that editor always have the time to actually vet the output? Probably not. And so the job of that junior is going to transform into, they need to be a subeditor. They need to be a content moderator almost, rather than a content generator.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that&#8217;s a skill that only comes from having written the content yourself. We learn by making mistakes, and if we are not making those mistakes because AI is generating the stuff, and either not making mistakes or making mistakes that we haven&#8217;t made before ourselves, and thus don&#8217;t recognize his mistakes. So my fear of the job losses aspect of AI is not that it&#8217;s going to wipe out people who are working already. It&#8217;s going to make that barrier to entry for the next generation, it&#8217;s knocking the bottom rung out of the ladder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And unless we change the ways that we teach people as they are entering the community, the WordPress community, the industry, and all the industries which AI is going to affect, the basics, and we focus on it. You know, it&#8217;s a catch 22. We have to teach people to do stuff without AI, so they can learn the basics. But at the same time, they also have to learn how to use AI so they can do the basics in the modern world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I mean, we get back to that old debate like, why am I learning trigonometry in school? Because maybe someday it actually helps you do your job. Admittedly, so far, not so much. But I will say this. History, I did history in school. That has surprisingly turned out to be one of the most useful subjects I ever did, just because it taught me how to write. Which I didn&#8217;t learn in English class. Go figure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:17] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It sounds like you are quite sanguine for now. If you are in the space and listening to this podcast now, everything is fine right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:26] <strong>James Dominy:</strong> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:27] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Maybe less sanguine for the future. Given that, do you think that AI more broadly needs to be corralled. There need to be guardrails put in place. There needs to be legislation. I don&#8217;t know how any of that works, but manufacturers of AI being put under the auspices of, well it would have to be governments, I guess. But some kind of system of checks and balances to make sure that it&#8217;s not, I don&#8217;t know, deliberately producing fakes. Or that the fakes are getting, the hallucinations are getting minimized. That it&#8217;s not doing things that aren&#8217;t in humanity&#8217;s best interests.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:59] <strong>James Dominy:</strong> Absolutely. Yes. Although I&#8217;m not sure how we could do a good job of it, to be fair. The whole concept of, we want AIs to operate in humanity&#8217;s best interests. Who decides? The alignment problem crops up here where, it&#8217;s well known that we can train an AI to do something we think that it&#8217;s going to do, and it seems to be doing that thing until suddenly it doesn&#8217;t.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we just get some weird output. And then when we go digging, we realize actually it was trying to solve an entirely different problem to what we thought we were training it on, that just happened to have a huge amount of overlap with the thing that we did. But when we get to those edge cases, it goes off in what we think is a wildly wrong direction. But it is solving the problem that it was trained to solve. We just didn&#8217;t know we were training it to solve that problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As far as regulation goes. Yes, I think regulation, it&#8217;s coming. I really want to say nobody could be stupid enough to put weapons in the hands of an AI. The human race has proved me wrong several thousand times already in history. Yeesh, I personally think that that&#8217;s an incredibly stupid idea. But then the problem becomes what&#8217;s a weapon?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because a weapon these days can be something as subtle as enough ability to control trading, high frequency trading. Accidentally crash a stock market. It&#8217;s already happened. Accidentally, and again, I&#8217;m air quoting the accidentally here, accidentally crash your competitor&#8217;s stock, or another nation&#8217;s stock market. AI is there, is being used as a validly useful tool to participate in the economy, but the economy can be used as a weapon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Putting AI in control of the water infrastructure in arid countries. Optimization, it can do those jobs a lot better. It can see almost instantaneously when there&#8217;s a pressure drop. So there&#8217;s a leak in this section of the pipe. Somebody needs to go fix it. And also it can just shut off the water to an entire section of the city because, I don&#8217;t know, it feels like it. Because for some reason it is optimizing for a different goal than we actually think we gave it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The trick is we can say, we can input into ChatGPT, I want you to provide water to the entire city in a fair and equitable way. That doesn&#8217;t mean that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s going to do. We just think that that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s going to do. We hope.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:42:26] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I think we kind of come back to where we started. If we had a crystal ball, and we could stare five, two years, three years, 10 years into the future. That feels like it would be a really great thing to have at the moment. There&#8217;s obviously going to be benefits. It&#8217;s going to make work certainly more productive. It&#8217;s going to make us be able to produce more things. But as you&#8217;ve just talked over the last 20 minutes or so, there&#8217;s also points of concern and things to be ironed out in the near term.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:42:52] <strong>James Dominy:</strong> Absolutely, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:42:53] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> We&#8217;re fast running out of time, so I think we&#8217;ll wrap it up if that&#8217;s all right? A quick one James, if somebody is interested, you&#8217;ve planted the seed of interest about AI and they want to get in touch with you and natter about this some more, where would they do that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:43:06] <strong>James Dominy:</strong> The best way is probably email. I am not a social person in the social media sense. I don&#8217;t have Twitter. I don&#8217;t do any of that. So I&#8217;m probably terrible for this when I think about it. My email is, J for Juliet, G for golf, my surname D O M for mother, I, N for November, Y for yankee at gmail.com. Please don&#8217;t spam. Please don&#8217;t get AI to spam me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:43:30] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, yeah. James Dominy, thank you so much for joining us today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:43:34] <strong>James Dominy:</strong> Thank you for the opportunity. It&#8217;s been great fun, and I&#8217;ve really enjoyed being able to kind of deep dive into a lot of the stuff I just had to gloss over in the workshop. Thank you.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today we have <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamesdominy/?originalSubdomain=ie\">James Dominy</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>James is a computer scientist with a masters degree in bioinformatics. He lives in Ireland, working at the WPEngine Limerick office.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the second podcast recorded at WordCamp Europe 2023 in Athens. James gave a talk at the event about the influence of AI on the WordPress community, and how it’s going to disrupt so many of the roles which WordPressers currently occupy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We talk about the recent rise of ChatGPT and the fact that it’s made AI available to almost anyone. In less than twelve months many of us have gone from never touching AI technologies to using them on a daily basis to speed up some aspect of our work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The discussion moves on to the rate at which AI systems might evolve, and whether or not they’re truly intelligent, or just a suite of technologies which masquerade as intelligent. Are they merely good at predicting the next word or phrase in any given sentence? Is there a scenario in which we can expect our machines to stop simply regurgitating text and images based upon what they’ve consumed; a future in which they can set their own agendas and learn based upon their own goals?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This gets into the subject of whether or not AI is in any meaningful way innately intelligent, or just good at making us think that it is, and whether or not the famous Turing test is a worthwhile measure of the abilities of an AI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>James’ background in biochemistry comes in handy as we turn our attention to whether or not there’s something unique about the brains we all possess, or if intelligence is merely a matter of the amount of compute power that an AI can consume. It’s more or less certain that given time, machines will be more capable than they are now, so when, if ever, does the intelligence Rubicon get crossed?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The current AI systems can be broadly classified as Large Language Models, or LLMs for short, and James explains what these are and how they work. How can they create a sentence word by word if they don’t have an understanding of where each sentence is going to end up? James explains that LLMs are a little more complex than just handling one word at a time, always moving backwards and forwards within their predictions to ensure that they’re creating content which makes sense, even if it’s not always factually accurate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We then move on from the conceptual understanding of AI to more concrete ways it can be implemented. What ways can WordPress users implement AI right now, and what innovations might we reasonably expect to be available in the future? Will we be able to get AI to make intelligent decisions about our website’s SEO or design, and therefore be able to focus our time on other, more pressing, matters?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a fascinating conversation whether or not you’ve used AI tools in the past.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Useful links.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt\">ChatGPT</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://stablediffusionweb.com/\">Stable Diffusion</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_model\">Markov Model</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 28 Jun 2023 14:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Nathan Wrigley\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:37;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:54:\"Akismet: How to Add CAPTCHA and reCAPTCHA to WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:27:\"http://akismet.com/?p=70973\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:43:\"https://akismet.com/blog/wordpress-captcha/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:25456:\"<p>Implementing a CAPTCHA or reCAPTCHA system is a highly effective way to protect your WordPress website or ecommerce business from spam and bots, which is crucial for ensuring online security.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All that sounds great, but the effort involved in solving a CAPTCHA often results in reduced conversions.

Make sure you’re aware of these downsides before you use a WordPress CAPTCHA plugin.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. They’re challenging for those with visual impairments</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Traditional CAPTCHA systems often rely on distorted images of text, making it difficult for users with visual impairments to solve them. This can lead to accessibility issues and discourage visitors from interacting with your site.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/image12.png\" alt=\"example of a CAPTCHA asking the user to select squares with red spheres\" class=\"wp-image-70975\" width=\"385\" height=\"463\" />\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. They create a frustrating experience&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>CAPTCHAs can be frustrating and time-consuming to solve, particularly when the distorted text is difficult to read. This annoyance can cause people to leave your site without completing their intended action, such as submitting a form or making a purchase. Sometimes, visitors may even have to solve multiple CAPTCHAs —&nbsp;a real test of endurance.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. They can generate false positives</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>CAPTCHA systems can sometimes incorrectly identify real human users as bots, preventing them from accessing your site or submitting forms. This can lead to a loss of leads, customers, or subscribers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. They’re easily bypassed by sophisticated bots</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As bots become more advanced, they’re increasingly able to bypass traditional CAPTCHA systems, rendering them less effective at preventing spam and malicious activity on your site.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. They can create a negative user experience</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Implementing CAPTCHA systems can negatively impact your site&#8217;s user experience, particularly when the CAPTCHAs are overly complex or difficult to solve. This can lead to lower visitor satisfaction and, ultimately, decreased engagement and conversions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6. They can lead to lower conversion rates</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As mentioned above, the frustrating experience of solving CAPTCHAs can lead to users abandoning your site before completing their intended actions. This can result in lower conversion rates for your business.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">7. They can cause higher page load times</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Implementing CAPTCHA systems can also contribute to slower page load times, as they often require additional resources and scripts to load. This can negatively impact your site&#8217;s performance and search engine rankings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given these challenges, it&#8217;s important to find a solution that’s both effective at preventing spam and bots, while also providing a positive user experience. That&#8217;s where Akismet comes in to save the day.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How does Akismet address these issues?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Akismet addresses the shortcomings of traditional CAPTCHA systems by employing advanced algorithms and a continuously-updated database of spam signatures. It can effectively identify and block spam and malicious activity without any user input and without annoying barriers for site visitors.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The result is enhanced accessibility, a superior user experience, and fewer false positives.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even the most sophisticated bots can be identified and blocked by Akismet due to its advanced spam detection technology and constantly-updated database.

Websites run for commercial purposes can choose from several affordable premium options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, install and activate the plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To do this, log in to your WordPress dashboard, go to the <strong>Plugins</strong> tab, click <strong>Add New</strong>, and search for it. The plugin is usually included in the top &#8220;<strong>Featured</strong>&#8221; list.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/image6.png\" alt=\"finding Akismet in the WordPress repository\" class=\"wp-image-70976\" width=\"450\" height=\"197\" />\n\n\n\n<p>To install the plugin, click on<strong> Install Now</strong> and then <strong>Activate</strong>. After activation, go to <strong>Settings</strong> and select <strong>Akismet Anti-Spam</strong>. Under <strong>Settings</strong>, locate the <strong>API key</strong> field.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can get the key by going to the Akismet website and creating an account.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/image7.png\" alt=\"Aksimet homepage with the text, \" />\n\n\n\n<p>Once you finish the signup process on the website, log in to your new account then locate <strong>My Account</strong> and choose <strong>Add Subscription</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can select your desired plan next. The <strong>Personal</strong> plan is free for individual website use if your site is considered &#8220;non-commercial.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After registering, you’ll receive an API key in the My Account section. Copy this key and then navigate to the WordPress dashboard&#8217;s <strong>Settings → Akismet Anti-Spam</strong> screen. Next, paste the key into the <strong>API Key</strong> field.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/image1.png\" alt=\"Akismet settings in WordPress\" class=\"wp-image-70979\" width=\"450\" height=\"267\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Click on <strong>Save Changes</strong> to finish.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Akismet will automatically filter comment spam and put it in a queue for review on the dashboard. But if you want it to work on your contact form(s), you&#8217;ll need to complete another step.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Step 2: Add Akismet to your contact form</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>By default, WordPress does not have a contact form feature. Therefore, you’ll need to use plugins to include contact forms on their sites. The method to add these forms will vary based on the plugin being used.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some popular contact form plugins, including <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/features/discussion/contact-forms/\">Jetpack</a>, already have Akismet support built-in.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other plugins necessitate setting up Akismet add-ons to incorporate spam protection into their forms. <a href=\"https://www.gravityforms.com/\">Gravity Forms</a> is the most popular example of this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still other WordPress plugins like <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/\">Contact Form 7</a> require a code snippet to add Akismet support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thankfully, it&#8217;s easy to configure Akismet on your contact forms, no matter which method you choose.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Step 3: Set up the anti-spam settings in Akismet</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Akismet is very much a set-it-and-forget-it type of tool. Just install, activate, and you&#8217;re basically done. But it also allows you to control how to handle contact form spam a bit more precisely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin is configured, by default, to send flagged comments to a holding queue located in the <strong>Comments</strong> section of the WordPress dashboard so that you can review them later. You can also set up Akismet to delete spam entirely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If this sounds appealing, just go to<strong> Settings → Akismet Anti-Spam</strong> and locate the <strong>Settings</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Scroll down to the section called <strong>Strictness</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/image10.png\" alt=\"Strictness settings for Akismet\" class=\"wp-image-70980\" width=\"450\" height=\"170\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Akismet is good at identifying which messages are spam and which ones are legitimate, which means you can delete the spam messages from your contact form without worry. However, if you want to keep all messages, you can select the option to <strong>Always put spam in the Spam folder for review</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember that Akismet stores spam comments for 15 days before they&#8217;re deleted. So, if you go for this option, review your queue regularly.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Still want to use CAPTCHA?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Although we suggest using Akismet due to its ease-of-use and success in blocking spam and bots, we realize that certain users may still want to learn how to add CAPTCHA to WordPress. This section will provide clear instructions on how to integrate both CAPTCHA and reCAPTCHA into a WordPress contact form.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. How to add CAPTCHA to a WordPress contact form</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Although most well-known contact form plugins include CAPTCHA functionality, you can also manually incorporate CAPTCHA into any form element on WordPress that&#8217;s being misused. This not only includes contact forms, but also comment forms, <a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/how-to-enable-or-disable-user-registration-in-wordpress/\">user registration pages</a>, login pages, and opt-in forms.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Step 1: Install and activate the Friendly CAPTCHA for WordPress plugin</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>For the purposes of this tutorial, we&#8217;re using the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/friendly-captcha/\">Friendly CAPTCHA for WordPress</a> plugins, though there are other options available.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Go to your WordPress dashboard then to <strong>Plugins → Add New</strong> and search for the plugin by name.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/image8-1.png\" alt=\"Friendly Captcha for WordPress plugin\" class=\"wp-image-70982\" width=\"225\" height=\"188\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Once you locate it, click <strong>Install → Activate</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Step 2: Add the site key and secret key</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>To input your<strong> </strong>Site key and Secret key, locate<strong> Friendly Captcha</strong> in the dashboard, then click <strong>Settings</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then go to the <a href=\"https://friendlycaptcha.com\">Friendly Captcha</a> website and create an account. Pick a plan, then copy your site key.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/image5.png\" alt=\"creating a Friendly Captcha account\" class=\"wp-image-70983\" width=\"450\" height=\"199\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Go back to your WordPress installation and paste in the<strong> Site key</strong> in the appropriate field. Then go back to your account on the website and generate an API key by typing in a name for it then clicking <strong>Create API Key.</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/image13.png\" alt=\"creating an API key\" class=\"wp-image-70984\" width=\"450\" height=\"195\" />\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Step 3: Finish configuring settings</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>For this tutorial, please select the comment form box to enable forms and keep all other settings at their default values to configure the remaining options based on your preferences.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Step 4: Save and view</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you&#8217;re done making changes, click <strong>Save Changes,</strong> then visit a live blog post to verify the comment form is working as intended.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. How to add reCAPTCHA to a WordPress contact form</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Google reCAPTCHA adds an extra layer of protection to your contact forms, using a two-step verification process. This tool can help stop bots and spammers, as they&#8217;ll need to pass the reCAPTCHA test. You can use a WordPress CAPTCHA plugin to get the job done. Here&#8217;s how you can incorporate it into your WordPress contact form:</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Step 1: Install and activate a WordPress reCAPTCHA plugin</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>First, install and activate the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-google-recaptcha/\">Simple Google reCAPTCHA plugin</a>. Just search for it by name under <strong>Plugins → Add New</strong>. Then click <strong>Install → Activate</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/image11.png\" alt=\"the Simple Google reCAPTCHA plugin\" class=\"wp-image-70985\" width=\"450\" height=\"251\" />\n\n\n\n<p>After activation, navigate to<strong> Settings → Google reCAPTCHA</strong> to configure the plugin settings.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Step 2: Configure the plugin settings</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin will prompt you to enter Google reCAPTCHA keys. You can obtain these keys for free from the official reCAPTCHA website by clicking the <strong>register your domain</strong> link at the top of the page.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/image2.png\" alt=\"warning to register your domain \" class=\"wp-image-70986\" width=\"450\" height=\"65\" />\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Step 3: Obtain reCAPTCHA API keys by registering your website</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The <strong>register your domain</strong> link directs you to the Google reCAPTCHA website, where you can register your site to work with reCAPTCHA.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sign in with your Google account, and you&#8217;ll see the <strong>Register a new site</strong> page. Enter the necessary basic information to register your site.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/image14.png\" alt=\"registering a site with Google\" class=\"wp-image-70987\" width=\"450\" height=\"190\" />\n\n\n\n<p>In the <strong>Label</strong> field, input your website name or any name of your choice to help you identify your site later.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Step 4: Add a new site</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, choose the <strong>reCAPTCHA V2</strong> radio button to reveal two new options.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/image9-1.png\" alt=\"options for reCAPTCHA type\" class=\"wp-image-70988\" width=\"450\" height=\"129\" />\n\n\n\n<p>To add the reCAPTCHA checkbox to your site, select the first option,<strong> I&#8217;m not a robot </strong>checkbox.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the <strong>Domains</strong> text box, add the domain name of your website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also add multiple domains or subdomains by clicking the plus <strong>+</strong> icon, enabling you to use the same API keys across different websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Step 5: Add domain and email to your reCAPTCHA site</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Google will automatically add your email address under <strong>Owners</strong>. You can also add another email if desired. Then accept the terms of service.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Select the <strong>Send alerts to owners</strong> checkbox to allow Google to send emails if they detect any misconfigurations or suspicious activity.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Step 6: Submit and register your WordPress site</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>After completing the form, click <strong>Submit</strong> to register your site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Google reCAPTCHA will display a success message, along with the site key and secret key.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Use these API Keys in your website&#8217;s plugin settings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Navigate to <strong>Settings → Google reCAPTCHA</strong> from your WordPress dashboard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the <strong>Settings</strong> page, paste the site key and secret key.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/image4.png\" alt=\"creating Google reCAPTCHA keys\" class=\"wp-image-70989\" width=\"450\" height=\"105\" />\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin will incorporate reCAPTCHA verification into the WordPress comment form, registration form, reset password form, new password form, and login form.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can disable reCAPTCHA on the login form by selecting the appropriate checkbox.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember to click <strong>Save Changes</strong> to store the API keys and activate reCAPTCHA.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You have now successfully added reCAPTCHA to your WordPress comment form. Check the comment section of your blog posts to ensure it&#8217;s working correctly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So now you know how to add CAPTCHA or reCAPTCHA to your WordPress contact forms. Although these options can reduce spam and bot activity, we suggest using Akismet instead because it is easy to use, more accessible, and effective against advanced bots.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless of the solution you choose, however, keeping your WordPress site secure from spam and malicious activity is crucial for maintaining a positive user experience, safeguarding your online presence, and protecting your reputation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Frequently asked questions about CAPTCHA and reCAPTCHA</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Still curious about CAPTCHA, reCAPTCHA, and how to safeguard the contact forms on your website? Let&#8217;s take a look at some answers to the most commonly asked questions on the subject.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is CAPTCHA?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>CAPTCHA, which stands for “Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart”, is a security measure used on websites to prevent automated bots from submitting forms, leaving comments, or performing other actions that should only be done by human users. CAPTCHAs typically require users to solve visual puzzles — such as identifying distorted text or selecting specific images — to prove that they’re not bots.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is reCAPTCHA?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>reCAPTCHA is a more advanced version of CAPTCHA developed by Google. It improves upon traditional CAPTCHA systems by incorporating machine learning and advanced risk analysis techniques to better differentiate between human users and bots. reCAPTCHA is designed to be more user-friendly, with some versions requiring people only to click a checkbox.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/image3.png\" alt=\"I\'m not a robot checkbox\" class=\"wp-image-70990\" width=\"315\" height=\"86\" />\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is Akismet?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Akismet is a powerful anti-spam solution for WordPress websites, developed by Automattic, the company behind WordPress.com. It uses advanced algorithms and a continuously-updated database of spam signatures to identify and block spam comments and form submissions, without requiring user input or creating accessibility barriers. Akismet operates in the background (kind of like an invisible CAPTCHA, in a sense), providing a seamless and user-friendly browsing experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Is Akismet better than CAPTCHA and reCAPTCHA?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While each solution has its own advantages, Akismet is generally considered more user-friendly and accessible compared to CAPTCHA and reCAPTCHA. It doesn&#8217;t require users to solve puzzles or enter codes, making it easier for those with visual impairments and providing a smoother browsing experience overall. Akismet is also highly effective at blocking spam and bots, even as they evolve and become more sophisticated.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Does Akismet integrate with contact form plugins like Contact Form 7?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, Akismet integrates with many popular WordPress contact form plugins, including Contact Form 7. By connecting Akismet to your contact form plugin, you can effectively protect your forms from spam submissions without the need for CAPTCHA or reCAPTCHA.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What are real-world examples of sites using Akismet?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Akismet is trusted by over 100 million websites worldwide, including well-known enterprise brands such as <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/\">Microsoft</a>, <a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/convertkit-customerstory/\">ConvertKit</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.bluehost.com/\">Bluehost</a>. Its widespread adoption and use by major companies serve as strong social proof for its effectiveness in preventing spam and ensuring a secure, user-friendly online experience.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Should you choose Akismet for your contact and registration forms, you&#8217;ll be in good company, joining millions of other websites that have successfully protected their online presence from spam and malicious activity.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Akismet: Non-intrusive spam protection for WordPress&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To keep your WordPress site free from <a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/spambots-theyre-not-just-like-us-introducing-akismets-newest-spam-fighting-feature/\">spam and bots</a> while ensuring a good user experience and accessibility, you should use Akismet. It offers an effective way to combat spam that doesn&#8217;t disrupt your site visitors&#8217; browsing experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you add Akismet to your WordPress site, it will use complex calculations and a big collection of spam markers to keep your site safe from unwanted content. In addition, it integrates smoothly with well-known tools for contact forms, making sure that everyone can use your website securely and without hassle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While CAPTCHA and reCAPTCHA may still be preferred by some, Akismet stands out as a user-friendly, effective, and accessible alternative for securing your WordPress contact forms against spam and bots. And by choosing Akismet, you&#8217;re investing in the success of your online presence and ensuring a pleasant experience for your visitors, which is definitely worth prioritizing.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 28 Jun 2023 13:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Jen Swisher\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:38;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"WPTavern: WordPress 6.3 Will Introduce A Command Palette\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=146321\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-6-3-will-introduce-a-command-palette\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3341:\"<p>Last week Gutenberg contributors were engaged in a spirited debate regarding <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-contributors-discuss-renaming-command-center-tool\">a proposal to rename the new Command Center to Wayfinder</a>. The feature, designed to be an extensible quick search and command execution tool, will land in WordPress 6.3.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The majority of participants in the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/50925\">discussion</a> were strongly against calling it Wayfinder, as the term doesn&#8217;t translate well, nor does it make the feature&#8217;s benefits easy to understand.  Wayfinder was proposed as a unique name that &#8220;has the potential to evoke a sense of curiosity, exploration, and discovery.&#8221; There were several attempts to wrap up the discussion with notes on alternatives even when it was apparent that the general consensus was unequivocally not in favor of the term Wayfinder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Automattic-sponsored Gutenberg contributor Anne McCarthy <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/50925#issuecomment-1610044400\">commented</a> on the issue with the decision, which she said was reached after consulting project leadership and reading through the comments:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p><em><strong>Let’s move forward with Command Palette.</strong></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reasoning: easier to translate, consistent across other tooling outside of WordPress, matches current functionality, eases discoverability/understanding of value, and leans generic which matches the concerns raised here. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, we can always discuss renaming if the feature reaches a point of evolution outside of this initial name. As raised above, that would be more worth risking a unique name for than something that exists in other products and that ultimately we want people to quickly understand/find value in. Plus if we hold off on that name for the future, it can create a nice marketing push for something truly unique when/if the time comes. If folks have additional specific concerns around this naming, please speak up sooner rather than later.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>McCarthy also requested other contributors ensure the re-naming is updated throughout the interface for the upcoming release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was an important decision that needed to be made ahead of WordPress 6.3 Beta 1, which was supposed to be released today but was <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/06/27/wordpress-6-3-beta-1-postponed/\">delayed</a> to Wednesday, June 28, due to an unrelated issue. The Command Palette will likely be introduced in blog posts, the 6.3 About page, and countless third-party resources so the proposal urgently needed a conclusion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s also to the team’s credit that they didn’t force a fancy marketing name and instead landed on the side of the majority of contributors who were in favor of using clear language. The API for the Command Palette <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/51169\">is now public</a> and ready for developers to create their own custom commands.

The previous year organizers were called out for the <a href=\"https://europe.wordcamp.org/2022/diversity-at-wceu/\">lack of diversity on the organizing team</a> and this year the complaint was a lack of diversity in the speaker selection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WCEU 2023 organizers published a <a href=\"https://europe.wordcamp.org/2023/transparent-selection-processes/\">transparent account of the various selection processes</a> used for organizers, speakers, media partners, and others involved in the event. The article states that organizers are shortlisted based on their skills, with an effort &#8220;to keep gender parity high whilst also selecting people from all available European WordPress communities.&#8221; It also states that applicants&#8217; experience and enthusiasm are chief among selection factors but organizers also reach out to encourage underrepresented groups to apply:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>During the selection process we don’t have anything that resembles a “positive discrimination” policy, whereby we choose people based on their race, color, background, gender, sexual identity, or any other attribute; we solely chose people based on their stated experience and enthusiasm to be part of the team&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Acknowledging that diversity within the Organizing team is important, we reach out to community groups and members before and during the application process, encouraging people to apply where we have historically seen underrepresentation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The article concludes with a statement of willingness to modify this selection process if the organization is not able to achieve a diverse lineup:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>WordCamp Europe is an iterative event; each year learns from the last and 2024 will be no different.

They give users the ability to apply the same layout to different posts and pages. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reusable blocks have now been <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/51144\">renamed to patterns</a>, with the option to be synced, which offers the same functionality as the former reusable blocks where all instances can be updated at once. Non-synced patterns are just regular patterns &#8211; those that can be edited independently of other other instances that have been inserted. These updates are coming in Gutenberg 16.1 and will be included in the upcoming WordPress 6.3 release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress contributor Aki Hamano posted a diagram to Twitter regarding the renaming, which was confirmed as an accurate representation of the changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I am trying to understand about the new naming of \"Pattern\" in WordPress.

Learning materials and documentation will need to be updated with very little notice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gutenberg contributor Daniel Richards encouraged contributors to see the change as part of &#8220;<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/41717\">the great unification</a>,&#8221; an effort towards consolidating the many different block types into a single concept and streamlining the content and site editors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;In the future it might also be possible for template parts to be considered &#8216;synced patterns&#8217;, and at that point things become much more streamlined and there are far fewer concepts for users to grasp,&#8221; Gutenberg contributor Daniel Richards said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;So the hope is that this is a first step on the path to making things easier for users, rather than more difficult. But I do realize that for existing users it&#8217;s quite a shift.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As part of this effort, WordPress 6.3 will also introduce pattern creation in the block editor using the same interface that it previously used for reusable blocks. Pattern creation necessitates having a place for users to view and manage their patterns. WordPress 6.3 will also include a first pass at <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/51078\">a Pattern Library inside the Site Editor</a>, which will include both patterns and template parts. Gutenberg designers shared <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/design/2023/06/19/design-share-jun-5-jun-16/?mc_cid=4941c0b11f&mc_eid=68ffa9a210\">a preview</a> of what this would look like a couple weeks ago:</p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/make.wordpress.org/design/files/2023/06/patterns.gif?ssl=1\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/make.wordpress.org/design/files/2023/06/patterns.gif?resize=776%2C540&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-11211\" /></a>image credit: <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/design/2023/06/19/design-share-jun-5-jun-16/?mc_cid=4941c0b11f&mc_eid=68ffa9a210\">WordPress Design Share June 5-16</a>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Potential of Partially Synced Patterns</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In May, contributors began a discussion about the concept of <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/discussions/50456\">partially synced patterns</a>, which Daniel Richards summarized:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>Today, when you insert a pattern, the blocks from that pattern are completely decoupled and standalone. There&#8217;s no way to tell that those blocks originated from a pattern, especially since they can be edited to no longer resemble the source pattern.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Partially synced mode is different. When a pattern that&#8217;s partially synced is inserted, it retains a reference to the source pattern. The blocks within the pattern are locked so that they cannot be removed or reordered and new blocks cannot be inserted (this is called&nbsp;<code>contentOnly</code>&nbsp;locking). Only specific parts of the pattern considered &#8216;content&#8217; can be edited (denoted by adding&nbsp;<code>__experimentalRole: \'content\'</code>&nbsp;to a block&#8217;s definition).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When the source pattern is updated, all instances of blocks that reference the source pattern are updated too (much like a reusable block), but the&nbsp;<code>content</code>&nbsp;values the user entered are retained. The best way to think of this is that the user can update the design of a pattern, but doesn&#8217;t lose content that exists in templates and posts.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>This concept will not make it into the upcoming version of WordPress, as contributors are still discussing one of many complex implementations, but it offers a glimpse of what might be more granular control coming to patterns in the future. Partially synced patterns would bring distinct benefits to many CMS and content design use cases where clients may be editing content. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I am a site developer for an agency, and am actively making sites for clients using Gutenberg every day,&#8221; Eric Michel said. &#8220;Probably our biggest pain point right now is that the editor does not handle types of content that are mostly standardized with small content customizations per post &#8211; things like contact directories, majors at a university, products in a catalog.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;For us, the absolute dream scenario is what you are proposing, except with the inclusion of the ability to alter the primary template and have all of the pages that use that template automatically change as well.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/discussions/50456\">discussion</a> on making partially synced patterns possible continues in search of an implementation that will ensure users don&#8217;t modify the patterns in ways that destroy the ability to display the retained content. WordPress 6.3 will ship with synced and non-synced pattern options, and partially synced patterns may land further down the road in a future release.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 27 Jun 2023 02:11:22 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:41;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:128:\"Gutenberg Times: Reusable Blocks are Patterns too, Style Book, Block Handbook Navigator and Command Center—Weekend Edition 258\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/?p=24511\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:135:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/reusable-blocks-are-patterns-too-style-book-block-handbook-navigator-and-command-center-weekend-edition-258/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:15495:\"<p>Howdy, </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s been a more quiet week.

Be aware that&#8217;s only the working title and contributors discuss renaming it. <strong>Sarah Gooding</strong> reports on the discussion <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-contributors-discuss-renaming-command-center-tool\"><strong>WordPress Contributors Discuss Renaming Command Center Tool</strong></a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"reusable\">Reusable blocks are now called Patterns</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Creating patterns using the block editor has been one of the most requested features since Patterns have been available and since the release of the Pattern directory on WordPress.org in Summer of 2021.  It&#8217;s now coming to the editor in WordPress 6.3 version. It uses the same workflow as creating reusable blocks. To remind you: create a collection of blocks, group them, and use the 3-dot menu &#8220;Create reusable Block&#8221; except it now says &#8220;Create custom pattern&#8221;. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Turns out Patterns and Reusable blocks are cut almost from the same cloth. The only difference is that the change to a reusable block synchs over all the instances the block has been used, hence the new name &#8220;synched pattern&#8221;.  There is now a toggle switch to &#8220;Keep all pattern instances in sync&#8221; or not. This is the first iteration: the name change and the creation workflow. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To re-use the pattern, you find them in different places, though. Synched patterns are listed in the list of Blocks in the Inserter and available via slash &#8220;/&#8221; command. Unsynched patterns are in a new Pattern category = Custom Patterns in the Patterns Tab in the big blue button inserter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many users, and I might be one of them, who find patterns, should also be at least partially sync-able. That feature is planned to come to the block editor after WordPress 6.3 is released. It will take a few more thoughts on how to separate the various pieces. You might want to synch the design but not the words, or styles but not the images. The headings but not the links. And immediately you see that this can be quite complicated. So, it might take some more time. You can read up on the genesis of this new feature in the PR <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/51144\">Reusable blocks: Rename to &#8216;Patterns&#8217; and add option to also add a non-synced Pattern.

Once enabled, it notifies users if a vulnerability is found and suggests actions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Really Simple SSL mirrors the free database with its own instance to secure stability and deliverability, but of course provides the origin database with an API to enrich, or improve its current data,&#8221; Really Simple Plugins developer Aert Hulsebos said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new vulnerability detection feature is not enabled by default, so users will need to <a href=\"https://really-simple-ssl.com/instructions/about-vulnerabilities/\">enable it in the settings</a>. A modal will pop up where users can configure their notifications and run the first scan.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>When emailed about a vulnerability users can manually respond with an action or set the plugin to automatically force an update (when available) after 24 hours of no response. There are other automated actions the plugin can take based on how users configure the Measures section of the settings.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>For the past several years Really Simple SSL has been providing SSL certificate configuration and installation via Let&#8217;s Encrypt as a first pass at securing WordPress sites. To finance this for the free users, the plugin also has a Pro version that handles Security Headers, such as Content Security Policies, which are highly complex for most and not easily configured.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We figured that with our reach we could impact security on the web as a whole, by adding features in order of impact on security,&#8221; Hulsebos said. &#8220;So vulnerabilities, after hardening features specific to WordPress, was next. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The nature of our partnership with Javier and WP Vulnerability is sponsoring the efforts of WP Vulnerability and appointing a security consultant ourselves to this open-source effort to improve, and moderate the open-source database daily. WP Vulnerability does not compensate us, nor does it have a stake in Really Simple SSL. Vulnerability detection is available for everyone and always will be.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because Really Simple SSL started as a lightweight SSL plugin, Hulsebos said they have taken a modular approach to minimize impact on users who only want or need certain features. Following the launch of the new vulnerability detection feature, the plugin&#8217;s authors plan to add login security with 2FA to better secure authentication on WordPress sites.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 23 Jun 2023 21:34:02 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:43;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:51:\"BuddyPress: BuddyPress community &amp; contribution\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://buddypress.org/?p=330214\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:65:\"https://buddypress.org/2023/06/buddypress-community-contribution/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:15099:\"<p>Last but not least!

No amount of new features will help if they can’t be discovered »</li>\n\n\n\n<li>« <strong>Lack of documentation</strong> for developers and code examples. Codex must be improved. »</li>\n\n\n\n<li>« BuddyPress still remains the best in the plugin industry but it <strong>needs more love</strong> from the community. »</li>\n\n\n\n<li>« BuddyPress has been suffering from a <strong>low number of contributors</strong> in recent years. »</li>\n\n\n\n<li>« ideology and maybe personal politics superseded the pushing of features that users wanted »</li>\n\n\n\n<li>« there was way <strong>too much push back</strong> on fixes and new features »</li>\n\n\n\n<li>« <strong>Key features never materialize</strong> »</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>A new theme for this community website is a must-have, I agree. Although our current theme does a good job, it has remained unchanged for years. We had begun to work on this but in a way that wasn’t in line with my conviction on this topic. That’s absolutely fine with me as long as we ship! It didn’t happen unfortunately, we didn’t manage to attract enough contributor energy. So I’m back with my conviction: we should build the Block Theme I told you about in episodes <a href=\"https://buddypress.org/2023/05/what-new-features-will-be-coming-to-buddypress/\">3</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://buddypress.org/2023/06/how-should-back-end-front-end-buddypress-interfaces-evolve/\">4</a> with the secondary goal of using it for BuddyPress’ network sites! In my opinion, we’d kill two birds with one stone <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f94c.png\" alt=\"🥌\" class=\"wp-smiley\" />.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ideally, all BuddyPress code should be available on our <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Trac environment</a>. It’s fine to use GitHub as it’s using Git which is more intuitive than SVN, but at some point (eg: when the feature is stable), the code should be mirrored on <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Trac</a>. We need a central place where people can open tickets, contribute to any parts of our project <strong>and be sure to be rewarded with our lovely contributors badge</strong>. Although I believe optional components (or any new Add-ons) should live in their own repository on the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress.org plugins directory</a>, I also think they should primarily live into our <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Trac</a> when it’s about contributing to their code. This way it will be easier for us to maintain all Add-ons making sure they behave nicely with each other when they are all activated. The confusions about where to contribute to the BP REST API experience convinced me that maintaining it on Trac once a stable version has been released (or included into Core for this API) is the right move to make (<em>not to mention the fact I need to explore many different places to credit all contributors to a major BuddyPress release</em>).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contributors shouldn’t be confused about where to contribute to BuddyPress, there’s only one <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/261d.png\" alt=\"☝\" class=\"wp-smiley\" />URL to know: <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/\" target=\"_blank\">https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Documentation is very important and, let’s face it, we’re not good at it <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f4d5.png\" alt=\"📕\" class=\"wp-smiley\" />. The <a href=\"https://codex.buddypress.org/\">codex</a> is not updated as frequently as it used to be, the « wiki » model where everyone can contribute to docs is no more efficient.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first 4 to 5 months of 2022, we’ve tried to organize <a href=\"https://buddypress.org/2022/04/march-documentation-contributor-meetings-summary/\">contributors meetings</a> to update the codex. The results were not at the level of our expectations:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>No new contributors showed up, code contributors &#8211; including me -(many thanks to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/dcavins/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">David</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/vapvarun/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Varun</a>) did their best but we missed some new energy to ship something concrete.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>As coders, we naturally put our efforts on the tools putting up this <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://imath-buddypress-codex.pf11.wpserveur.net/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">staging site</a>, and retrospectively, I think these efforts should have been directed on content.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>We couldn’t work on any plugin major release during this period.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"documentation\">I believe we need a <strong>Documentation leader</strong> <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f468-200d-1f3eb.png\" alt=\"👨‍🏫\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> to organize this part, lead a documentation team and carry on the work we started on splitting resources between two targets (end-users and developers) :</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>use</strong>.buddypress.org: would replace the <a href=\"https://codex.buddypress.org/\">codex</a> and contain resources about using BuddyPress</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.buddypress.org/\">developer.buddypress.org</a>: it was built during <a href=\"https://buddypress.org/2019/09/buddypress-5-0-0-le-gusto/\">BuddyPress 5.0</a> development cycle to provide our REST API endpoints reference. We need to complete it with <s>a Plugin</s> an Add-on handbook, a Theme handbook and BuddyPress code reference.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>We <a href=\"https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/8897#comment:3\">have recently decided</a> to include a docs subdirectory to our main BuddyPress repository. This is where <strong>documentation (and its history) will primarily live from now on! </strong>This move reflects the fact we acknowledge documentation is as important as code.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<a href=\"https://buddypress.org/wp-content/uploads/1/2023/06/contributor-badges.png\"><img width=\"583\" height=\"386\" src=\"https://buddypress.org/wp-content/uploads/1/2023/06/contributor-badges.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-330220\" /></a></div>\n\n\n<p>And we’ll reward documentation contributors just like code contributors with props &amp; a BuddyPress contributor badge on their WordPress.org profile (as shown above).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://buddypress.org/support/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">support forums</a> is another strategic area <strong>we absolutely need to be better on</strong>. Some figures about it are very impressive, eg: there are 127,716 posts inside the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://buddypress.org/support/forum/how-to/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><u>How-to &amp; Troubleshooting</u></a> category. Do we still need all these posts? I’m sure we don’t: some posts are probably about very old versions of BuddyPress and can be misleading nowadays. We should archive what’s no more up to date, have a specific tag for resolved questions, get rid of duplicates, etc. There again, I believe we need a <strong>Support leader</strong> to tackle all manner of improvements and manage a team of support contributors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Last but not least</strong>: how do we collaborate about plugin features or fixes?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I believe it’s what’s at the root of the 3 last key feedbacks. I can understand some frustrations you shared because I’m feeling the same <strong>regularly </strong>when it comes to contributing to WordPress code. As a contributor it’s difficult to be pushed back for reasons we do not agree on or that we don’t understand, to see a ticket postponed indefinitely or even worst to be ignored. I personally try to always write a few words in my ticket replies to say « hi, thanks for your feedback » or explain why I’m not sure we should do what you’re suggesting because <strong>I value your contribution &amp; I know it’s important for you</strong>. We can agree or disagree, we can change our minds, we can take bad decisions, the most important is to <strong>act at some point with BuddyPress community interests in mind</strong>. We can always act again to revert some mistaken changes. We all learn from our mistakes and <strong>I’d rather </strong><strong>make</strong><strong> a lot of mistakes than stay still</strong>. Here’s my advice if you strongly believe we should fix an issue or add a new feature: have it built and share it with us as <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://codex.buddypress.org/participate-and-contribute/contribute-with-code/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">patches</a> or <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://bpdevel.wordpress.com/2022/03/06/using-pr-to-share-your-patches-on-buddypress-trac/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">pull requests</a>. Most of the time <strong>doing is half deciding</strong>!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes we currently have a « low number of contributors » and yes I believe BuddyPress deserves more love <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2764.png\" alt=\"❤\" class=\"wp-smiley\" />. Again you are all welcome to express yourselves on code, documentation, support, events, etc. Don’t hesitate to contribute even if you just started BuddyPressing, we’ll always help you and believe my experience, you’ll learn a lot. I had no ideas about PHP Object Oriented programming, PHPUnit, Continuous Integration, React, SASS etc.. <strong>I’ve learnt all this contributing to BuddyPress</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, <strong>one more thing</strong>: let’s meet during a BuddyCamp, a BuddyPress online meeting or at least do talk about BuddyPress during as much as possible contributor days or WordCamps! If you need help with your contribution table or with your slides, don’t be shy or afraid: ask us about it <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/messages/buddypress\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>!</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Props <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f917.png\" alt=\"🤗\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> !</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>First: many thanks to <a href=\"https://buddypress.org/members/dcavins/\">@dcavins</a> for his review <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f60d.png\" alt=\"😍\" class=\"wp-smiley\" />.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many thanks for your feedbacks, it’s a great first step, what about contributing to your ideas with us as a next step?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David McCan, Derin Tolu, basicD, Tom Watts, Sander van Dragt, Mr David Hoy, Tara, Jann, Vicent Nemeyimana, Bryant, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://buddypress.org/members/muhittinsahilli/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">muhittinsahilli</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://buddypress.org/members/johnjamesjacoby/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">johnjamesjacoby</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://buddypress.org/members/ok2net/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ok2net</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://buddypress.org/members/espellcaste/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">espellcaste</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://buddypress.org/members/riversdale1844/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">riversdale1844</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://buddypress.org/members/djpaul/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">djpaul</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://buddypress.org/members/dimensionmedia/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">dimensionmedia</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://buddypress.org/members/sunsetcowboy/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">sunsetcowboy</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://buddypress.org/members/egyptimhotep/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">egyptimhotep</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://buddypress.org/members/staion/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">staion</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://buddypress.org/members/shahriar83/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">shahriar83</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://buddypress.org/members/unsalkorkmaz/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">unsalkorkmaz</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://buddypress.org/members/osmor1/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">osmor1</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://buddypress.org/members/giannis4/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">giannis4</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://buddypress.org/members/gomle/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">gomle</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://buddypress.org/members/fanvid/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">fanvid</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://buddypress.org/members/fawp/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">fawp</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://buddypress.org/members/coolhunt/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">coolhunt</a> &amp; <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://buddypress.org/members/imath/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">imath</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 23 Jun 2023 19:33:39 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12:\"Mathieu Viet\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:44;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"WPTavern: WordPress Pattern Directory Updated to Show Curated Patterns by Default\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=146143\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:92:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-pattern-directory-updated-to-show-curated-patterns-by-default\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3905:\"<p>If you haven&#8217;t visited the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/patterns/\">WordPress Pattern Directory</a> lately, it may look very different from when it <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/the-wordpress-org-block-pattern-directory-now-live\">launched two years ago</a>. At first there was an emphasis on getting the community to contribute to the resource but the directory has now passed more than 1,500 patterns. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contributors are making changes to provide a more curated experience ahead of the inclusion of <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/44611\">a new Pattern Directory Explorer</a> that is still in progress. A recent <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2023/06/09/new-curation-filter-in-pattern-directory/\">update</a> to the Pattern Directory alters the homepage and category pages to show curated patterns by default, a change that has been a bit confusing for some when returning to the directory. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Anyone know where all the block patterns have gone on <a href=\"https://t.co/LpzR9lR7uc\">https://t.co/LpzR9lR7uc</a> ? <a href=\"https://t.co/Dt9EK7Ssik\">https://t.co/Dt9EK7Ssik</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/gutenberg?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#gutenberg</a></p>&mdash; Jamie Pootlepress &#8211; YouTuber and WP Plugin builder (@pootlepress) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pootlepress/status/1671881903593623556?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 22, 2023</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>The curated patterns are those by WordPress.org &#8211; the core bundled patterns. Community-contributed patterns are available as a filter in the dropdown of the directory&#8217;s menu.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>There are only 46 core patterns, so some category pages tend to look a little sparse and far less colorful than when community patterns are selected. At the moment, having curated patterns display by default does not offer the best experience for users coming to browse, as Pootlepress founder Jamie Marsland pointed out on Twitter. Automattic-sponsored contributor Rich Tabor responded that there is still more work to be done on providing a better curated experience in the Pattern Directory. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The top ones are the best.

In this discussion, Automattic-sponsored contributor Anne McCarthy suggested these pattern bundles could be automatically submitted to the directory upon the theme&#8217;s approval, which would make it effortless for theme authors to contribute them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Updates to the Pattern Directory&#8217;s filtering are part of the redesign work on WordPress.org and more discussions are happening on <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/pattern-directory/issues/\">the Pattern Directory GitHub</a> repository.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 23 Jun 2023 17:44:29 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:45;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:70:\"WPTavern: WordPress.com Makes Monetization Features Available for Free\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=146188\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-com-makes-monetization-features-available-for-free\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3111:\"<p>WordPress.com has been known to <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-com-ends-recent-pricing-experiment-reverts-to-previous-model\">experiment with its pricing</a> from time to time, and the platform announced another major change today. Users on the Free plan are now able to use monetization features without upgrading. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the past, WordPress.com users who wanted to earn money on their websites by collecting donations, creating a newsletter, or selling items or subscriptions, had to be on one of the paid plans. These <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/support/monetize-your-site/\">monetization features</a> are now available to all users on all tiers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fee structure varies, based on the user&#8217;s plan.  Transaction fees are the highest for Free users at 10%, but it gives creators the opportunity to see if they can make money without it costing anything upfront. Commerce plan users ($70/month or $45/month billed annually) don&#8217;t pay any transaction fees. Stripe also collects 2.9% + US$0.30 for each payment made to a Stripe account in the US.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<table><tbody><tr><td><strong>WordPress.com Plan</strong></td><td><strong>Payment Fees</strong></td></tr><tr><td>WordPress.com Commerce</td><td>0%</td></tr><tr><td>WordPress.com Business</td><td>2%</td></tr><tr><td>WordPress.com Premium</td><td>4%</td></tr><tr><td>WordPress.com Personal</td><td>8%</td></tr><tr><td>WordPress.com Free</td><td>10%</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n\n\n<p>Self-hosted WordPress users already have many free plugin options to monetize theirs sites but with that comes the requirement of knowing how to maintain and update their own sites. WordPress.com&#8217;s offering is targeted at creators who just want to get started making money online. The company is inching closer to being a one-stop shop for websites, especially as it <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/blog/2023/06/21/how-to-transfer-your-domain-to-wordpresscom/\">makes a play for former Google Domains customers</a> who are looking for somewhere to host domains after theirs were sold to Squarespace.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s important to note that creating a full-featured online store is still restricted to Business and Commerce plans. Using <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/support/pay-with-paypal/\">Pay with PayPal</a> to accept credit and debit card payments via PayPal is also only available via an upgraded plan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress.com&#8217;s <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/pricing/\">pricing</a> page has not yet been updated to reflect monetization features as being free &#8211; i.e. the Personal plan still lists paid subscribers and premium content gating as an upgrade. It&#8217;s possible the team hasn&#8217;t edited that page yet or this may be another pricing experiment. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Expanding the availability of monetization features is likely to be received as a positive change, since users are not losing any features that were previously free. Instead, they have the opportunity to see if they can monetize and then adjust their plans based on their comfort level with the transaction fees extracted.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 22 Jun 2023 22:58:38 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:46;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:57:\"WPTavern: Gravatar Adds New Payment Features for Profiles\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=146134\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"https://wptavern.com/gravatar-adds-new-payment-features-for-profiles\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3203:\"<p>Up until yesterday, the Gravatar (Globally Recognized Avatar) blog lay dormant for nine years, the <a href=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/2014/07/23/something-funny-happened/\">last post</a> chronicling how the team set out to create a Gravatar app that somehow &#8220;<a href=\"https://wptavern.com/automattics-planned-gravatar-app-morphs-into-a-selfies-app-for-android\">morphed into a Selfies app</a>.&#8221; Communication went silent after that, although the Twitter account posted occasionally.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The service has pivoted to become &#8220;a personal digital business card&#8221; where users can link to various apps and websites that help to establish their identities online. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gravatar announced this week that it has <a href=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/2023/06/21/new-on-gravatar-collect-payments-on-the-go/\">launched new payment features for profiles</a>.

In this episode, they discuss the importance of finding personal fulfillment, embracing the journey, and enjoying the process of pursuing hobbies and personal projects. They encourage everyone to reevaluate their definition of success and find meaning in the act of creation while also cherishing the connections and collaborations that come along the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Top Takeaways:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Redefining Success and Goals</strong>: The idea of reevaluating one&#8217;s definition of success. Instead of solely focusing on financial gain or external measures, there is a shift towards valuing the impact and value brought to others through one&#8217;s work or personal projects. Success is viewed as creating something meaningful that brings joy or usefulness to users rather than solely pursuing monetary goals.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Importance of Collaboration and Connection</strong>: The value of collaboration and building connections with like-minded individuals. The joy derived from hobbies or personal projects can be enhanced by sharing experiences, exchanging ideas, and working together with others. Building lasting friendships and relationships through shared interests can be a source of support and fulfillment.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Embracing the Process and Finding Fulfillment in the Journey</strong>: The importance of enjoying the process and finding fulfillment in the act of creating or working on something rather than solely focusing on the end result. The journey itself, the learning, the challenges, and the growth that occur along the way can be sources of joy and satisfaction. It&#8217;s about finding meaning and enjoyment in the present moment rather than solely fixating on the outcome.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading eplus-wrapper\" id=\"h-mentioned-in-the-show\"><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f517.png\" alt=\"🔗\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> Mentioned in the show:</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://crop.express/\">Crop.Express</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://balsamiq.com/\">Balsamiq</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/\">Meetup.com</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://slack.com/trials?remote_promo=f4d95f0b&d=7013y000002pzGQAAY&nc=7013y000002q165AAA&utm_source=google&utm_medium=paid_search&utm_campaign=ppc_google_amer_en_brand_selfserve_discount&utm_content=slack-pg-ss-all-us-brand_7013y000002pzGQAAY&utm_term=Slack_Exact_._slack_._e_._c_._611662283461&gad=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwv8qkBhAnEiwAkY-ahrvtUlvMruMS8SCCYA3MqgkRfViYepC5CP2yCdrFJkc4X3xdPxz3sxoCzVcQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds\">Slack</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.com/\">WordPress</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/\">Twitter</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/\">Instagram</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading eplus-wrapper\" id=\"h-you-can-follow-post-status-and-our-guests-on-twitter\"><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f426.png\" alt=\"🐦\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> You can follow Post Status and our guests on Twitter:</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"eplus-wrapper\">\n<li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/coreymaass\">Corey Maass</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/corymiller303\">Cory Miller</a> (CEO, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/post_status\">Post Status</a>)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/lemonadecode\">Olivia Bisset</a> (Intern, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/post_status\">Post Status</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"eplus-wrapper has-background\">The <strong>Post Status Draft</strong> podcast is geared toward WordPress professionals, with interviews, news, and deep analysis. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f4dd.png\" alt=\"📝\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /><br /><br /><a href=\"https://poststatus.com/category/post-status-podcasts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Browse our archives</a>, and don’t forget to subscribe via <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/post-status-draft-wordpress/id976403008\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">iTunes</a>, <a href=\"https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5zaW1wbGVjYXN0LmNvbS8ySkU5c2M4UA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Google Podcasts</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/PostStatus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">YouTube</a>, <a href=\"http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/krogsgard/post-status-draft-wordpress-podcast\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Stitcher</a>, <a href=\"https://wordpress-post-status-draft-podcast.simplecast.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Simplecast</a>, or <a href=\"https://feeds.simplecast.com/2JE9sc8P\">RSS</a>. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f3a7.png\" alt=\"🎧\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading eplus-wrapper\" id=\"h-transcript\">Transcript</h2>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Session 18 Corey &amp; Cory Launch a WordPress Product Live</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>C&amp;C 18</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:00] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> And don&#8217;t forget to record this time. Yeah, no.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:23] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Excellent. All right everybody. Welcome back to Corey and Cordy launching a pro WordPress product live session 18. And we&#8217;ve had, we were just kind of in prep for this real quick, just talking about a little of the things that&#8217;s been going on in our lives. It&#8217;s always fun to talk real life with a great person like Corey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, um, this time we&#8217;re just gonna kind of talk about catching up. We&#8217;ve been out kind of the last two, maybe three weeks I wanna say. Yep. And, um, I have been on, uh, uh, last week I was at CLOUDFEST in Austin for post status. Then we extended and went on a Epic Clark w Griswold type. Um, Road trip. Got to see Carlsbad Caverns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and, and they were closed. Yes. No, dead ants on the roof of the minivan. When we did render vans, I had to go Griswold South. Um, but I know you&#8217;ve had things going on too, so, um, that&#8217;s a little snippet for me just trying to kinda get things a little bit better sane for me work-wise. And, um, I think that&#8217;s in preparation for the.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Real conversation here, but um, you wanna Yeah. Updates on what you&#8217;ve been&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:36] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> up to. Yeah. And on my end, so it&#8217;s, I&#8217;ve, so I&#8217;ve got, you know, one, one main client and, uh, I have a monthly. They, they ask me to stay within a window of, of how much I work and what, uh, what I actually like about that is I tend to work a little less the beginning of the month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and then, uh, which lets me work on side projects or lets me work on the house or whatever. Uh, Um, and then towards the end of the month, you know, the days get longer to make sure I hit my quota, um, and maximize my budget. But, um, so at the beginning of the month I wound up helping my dad drive from South Carolina up to Maine, um, which is a really fun road trip with dad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, you know, and of course the, the client website goes down when I&#8217;m the farthest from my computer. Uh, you know, sitting at a restaurant in, uh, Fredericksburg, Virginia, if you ever have the opportunity, it&#8217;s a beautiful little place to stop. Um, but anyway, and then you can probably hear from my voice. I think last week I begged off because I was sick as a dog.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, And it&#8217;s funny, it actually, you&#8217;re like, oh, it&#8217;s been I think two, three weeks and I&#8217;m like, it feels like it&#8217;s been months. Cuz I spent at least, uh, a few days last week. Literally just in bed in a NyQuil haze, you know? So it felt like weeks went by and, um, you know, and then you come out of that and you&#8217;ve gotta scramble to make up work and, um, get caught up on life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, um, and then for me time, um, Always means house projects. So we&#8217;ve built another, uh, 11 times eight. So 88 feet of fencing. No. And then we turn a corner, so about 120 feet of fencing, stockade, fencing, cuz we&#8217;re getting a new foster dog. Um, and uh, so setting up a room for him and anyway, yeah, it just gets crazy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, uh, and so I think you and I touched. Space briefly last week and, and said, okay, so, you know, that&#8217;s fine. We missed a week or two. Let&#8217;s, let&#8217;s start, um, moving forward. I was like, all right, you know, I&#8217;m still working on a review of, uh, the product. I&#8217;ll get you a new version for post status. I don&#8217;t think you heard from me until nine minutes ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, that never happened. So, yeah. You know, but it&#8217;s like, and I hate to. It, it&#8217;s easy to fall into like, well, it&#8217;s not out yet, so it, you know, there are no expectations other than our own. Yeah. Which is true. Um, you know, but it&#8217;s also like, I mean, this is, this is part of why we do this, right? Like, yeah. We&#8217;re, we&#8217;re at least part of our, our aspirations is, is freedom, uh, to make our own choices, to manage our own hours, to work on what we wanna work on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, which also means, I mean, family comes first and health comes first, and Yeah. You know, and, and paying clients come first when you&#8217;re at this stage. So, you know, these are just things we have to juggle and, and keep trying to make progress. I mean, it says everything to me that. You and I at least are like, okay, let&#8217;s keep talking once a week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where are we at? You know? And, and cuz I have other people who I&#8217;ve worked with who many, many other people who, who ghost or who just wanna stop. There&#8217;s, there&#8217;s inherently so much shame in all of it that the moment they miss a day or a deadline or don&#8217;t hit the mark in some fashion, don&#8217;t want to talk about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, I have friends who we&#8217;ve been talking about, Collaborating for years talking about like music or art or whatever. And, and now we, we, we&#8217;ve gone months where we&#8217;ll talk every week or every month, you know, how are you, how are the kids, da, da da. And we literally won&#8217;t, we won&#8217;t talk about the subject now because there&#8217;s, you know, because we didn&#8217;t, one of us didn&#8217;t move forward with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s shame associated with it, so, you know. Definitely none of it&#8217;s that important, you know?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:56] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Yeah, exactly. Like we started with really good intentions and openness. Um, what it occurs to me is just kinda your references back to music and bands and stuff is like, I&#8217;ve not, I, I played an instrument when I was in like middle school, but I&#8217;ve not been in a band, but it&#8217;s occurs to me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s like, it seems like that you&#8217;re, mm-hmm. Stru, you know, struggling to kinda get something going. And then there&#8217;s seasons of life that happened. Um, this, this stage of my life and my career, I really see more of the seasonal aspects of life. Yeah. Better than I ever have. And you go. You know, just things you don&#8217;t, you can&#8217;t anticipate, or if you tried to, you&#8217;d have another set of problems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, um, it&#8217;s just like you said, like we&#8217;ve got other priorities, but, uh, it&#8217;s important for us to keep talking. I, I think too, when I think about entrepreneurship, I think there&#8217;s like part real hard work just doing things, trying to do it consistently, getting things out there, getting the next thing, and then there&#8217;s this bigger part.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which is, maybe somebody would&#8217;ve called it luck, you know? But it is like magic. You know? You stay around doing something. Maybe bands operate like this, I don&#8217;t know, but like you, you got enough interest, you know something&#8217;s there, you just haven&#8217;t figured it out yet. And then a magical moment, and I say magic cuz it&#8217;s like oftentimes in my career, specifically my professional career as an entrepreneur couldn&#8217;t have planned those things, man.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They just happened, you know? Um, however, I might have tried to take credit for them. They just happened and it&#8217;s like the reading I&#8217;ve been and work I&#8217;ve been doing too personally is like creativity. You don&#8217;t control creativity. Those really magical moments we&#8217;re talking about, they kind of blossom out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there was somebody I was just like, well, Anna, who runs feeder bars, Lindsay and her have been friends for a decade, you know? Anna tried so many things over the years, so many things, and then Vita Bars was the spark, the magic that made it happen. Mm-hmm. Now, now she&#8217;s full-time with it and she&#8217;s got employees and all that kind of stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So like all that time it&#8217;s kinda like learning the piano. People go, oh, you&#8217;re at the piano. You&#8217;re doing this beautiful thing at the wedding, or whatever it is. They don&#8217;t think about all those years spent. Right. You know, in the practice of it, and it&#8217;s kinda like that moment too. It&#8217;s like, I&#8217;m dribbing for a second, but do enough things to get to a moment that, that you probably didn&#8217;t plan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think most of us, at least the entrepreneurs I know would say. Yep. That&#8217;s about it. Absolutely. Yeah. However, we like to think we control it and plan it. We don&#8217;t.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:59] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> And there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s time. Sometimes you, you, you ha you just have to let time go by. It&#8217;s like, in music, it&#8217;s one of the hardest things I&#8217;ve, I&#8217;ve had to learn.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s like for years I made music and put out music, made music, and put out music. And then I actually started writing music that people were like, oh, this is a summertime song. It&#8217;s the end of the summer. We&#8217;re not gonna put it out now. That&#8217;d be dumb. So we&#8217;re gonna sit on it and you, and it&#8217;s like in actual pop music, you can find out that there, there were pop songs, but huge, huge hits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And in our minds, you know, you&#8217;re picturing, you know, Taylor Swift yesterday was in the, in the recording studio and then today you&#8217;re hearing the song cuz that&#8217;s cuz music can be live. Um, and in this day and age, sometimes that&#8217;s true and it&#8217;s a truer than it used to be. It used to be that, you know, a band would go into a studio and produce an album and it would take months and yada yada, you know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But a lot of the times thing, tunes or tracks or albums are actually held back. To try to be released strategically. It&#8217;s like big movies that sit on shelves for, you know, years potentially, because they&#8217;re like, this is a Christmas day blockbuster, we&#8217;re not gonna release, you know, or a summertime when all the kids are outta school type of movie.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, we&#8217;re not gonna release it on the second day of school on a Tuesday. That&#8217;s dumb, you know? Um, but we don&#8217;t, we don&#8217;t really think about that, but, There&#8217;s sometimes there&#8217;s strategic reasons and sometimes like this where it&#8217;s like, I&#8217;m a lot better about it than I used to be, especially since, um, years ago now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So for a while I tried to make music an actual career or second career, um, and it really broke my heart. And so I stepped away from it for a while, and then when I was getting back into it, this is where having an amazing spouse is worth everything. Lindsay and I sat down, my Lindsay spelled with an A, sat down and, and she&#8217;s like, okay, so you, you know, you wanna get back into music.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Great. Like, how do we, how does it not break your heart again? And one of the things that, that. Came outta that conversation was me being able to articulate like, okay, I&#8217;m not taking it as seriously this time, it&#8217;s a hobby. Mm-hmm. And, and so suddenly a lot of things changed. One, you know, I couldn&#8217;t just go out and, and buy new instruments or, you know, throw money at it the way I used to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure. But it also meant that like I could work on, like, I have found that I make a lot of. Music in the fall and then tend to not make any music, but it, but a lot of that music that I finish, I can like leak out again, a track a month or I can wait until summertime and put it out or whatever. And so it&#8217;s like I&#8217;ve got these big waves rather than it just being, you know, picturing this straight line of productivity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and I think it, that kind of goes for this, this stuff too, like, This stuff. Uh, entrepreneurship side hustles. They&#8217;re, they&#8217;re side hustles. And for a long time I, I was like, I want this to be a day job. Still would love it. I&#8217;d still love my own product to be my primary focus. Then it&#8217;s a job that&#8217;s very different, right from, um, side, side hustles, um, ideas, putting out little apps, little ideas, um, little products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, um, so. And so it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s picking things up, putting things down, um, and, and these days being okay with, again, letting some time go by or occasionally changing priorities even for a, a little while. Um, cuz there was a time when. I remember one time in particular that I was like, I was in between paying client gigs and came up with an idea [00:13:00] for an app and was like, okay, I&#8217;ve gotta crank this out and then it&#8217;s also gotta make money.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it was like the dumbest little idea. I won&#8217;t even share it, I&#8217;m embarrassed. Um, but it was like, it was an app that nobody wanted, you know? It solved a problem that nobody had. It was just an idea. But I remember like, Going, this is the first time where I, I, it has to make money. And I was like, it&#8217;s never gonna make money.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, and I&#8217;m, so, I&#8217;m putting myself in danger here. That&#8217;s dumb. You know? Um, and that&#8217;s not to say that there aren&#8217;t entrepreneurial journeys. With VC capital or, you know, we&#8217;ve gotta double down and, and make this our full-time gig and all that stuff. But it&#8217;s like, at least for me, I find often that I&#8217;m, if I&#8217;m making decisions from a position of desperation, of, of need.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That I&#8217;m not gonna make the best decision, you know, cuz my priorities, I can&#8217;t have any, I can&#8217;t have proper perspective on it. So, stepping back for a few weeks, honestly, what I look forward to is going back into my code, realizing that I did everything wrong and cleaning it up and then it&#8217;s a better product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, and you know, are we the worst off for having missed a few weeks? Maybe. Who can say nothing&#8217;s obvious? Um, you know, but again, you know, just trying to keep moving forward with it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:19] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> I think it&#8217;s like when we&#8217;re thinking about bands and hit music or products and entrepreneurs think about, you know, with or, and Anna and yours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My experience in this is like, If there&#8217;s enough of a fire to keep it going. Mm-hmm. You know, just enough. It doesn&#8217;t have to be a bonfire. There&#8217;ll be times of that for sure, but, but then mostly it&#8217;s probably just. Sometimes a little candle, sometimes just a little mini campfire. But if there&#8217;s enough in fuel in there that there&#8217;s something here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think time is on your, like you said, as time goes by, time is on your side because yeah, it&#8217;s only a matter of time where th where things kinda move and shift and the, the market, the world where you&#8217;re like that. Some of the classic stories, the person I&#8217;m thinking of, I think it&#8217;s a product company and how it came out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s just a recent example, but the classic ones were in Founders at Work where you almost stumbled into, backed into what became the hit thing. But you couldn&#8217;t have kind of planned that. Right. Um, where you were just keeping on a path enough, knew something was here, didn&#8217;t thought you had a beat on it a couple of times, and then just really it was just.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fire was stoked long enough where something did really hit and it became this, it, it became its own thing, I guess. Yeah. Lot of the, and I&#8217;m not, go ahead. A lot of the entrepreneurial stories I hear, they aren&#8217;t like the VC route. We saw a big market and we went after and we got a big money. Uh, that&#8217;s a, that&#8217;s an outlier I think, um, for the, Millions of us, the rest of us, I think it&#8217;s mostly backing into something, staying around long enough to find the opportunity that really fits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:09] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Yeah. Chipping away at it, having, having fun with it, working around real life needs, family, money, mortgages, healthcare, you know, that kind of stuff. And it&#8217;s like, and that&#8217;s kind of the difference. Like I, I have friends who I. Are, have always wanted to do something. And I&#8217;m like, so outside of their job and, and so I&#8217;m like, so do something, you know, talking art, music, entrepreneurship, whatever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s like you just, you, you, you have it in you or you don&#8217;t is one aspect and then the timing is right. Where it&#8217;s like you have that drive and you look around and you&#8217;re like, okay, right now I&#8217;ve got a couple hours a day where I&#8217;ve got. Whatever commitment you need, you know, to work at it. And so, um, and I think you and I also, I mean this is, this is the warm and fuzzy moment, but it&#8217;s like you and I also I think, have looked for an opportunity to work together for a long time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s like we will continue to be friends and, you know, hopeful partners in something kind of always, you know. Yep. Um, I do have to say that. We have to keep the fire burning at least long enough to, so that I get to rock the swag at WordCamp us. That&#8217;s true. These are the, these are the real important things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:40] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Um, yeah, a absolutely. I know. Um, no, and I think that&#8217;s the other part on, down to this is, you know, at the base I enjoy our conversations. It it, it&#8217;s this hot, crazy hobby we might have of. Seeing what&#8217;s out there, seen, seeing something following the path down it. And, uh, I still believe in the product. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, but it&#8217;s funny, it&#8217;s like I believe in the product, but I also believe in the path that might lead to something else. Yeah. Because, I mean, well, we&#8217;re on our second iteration of a product. Like, not even same product, there&#8217;s similarities. Mm-hmm. But like, we went down this path to here and I think it just adds to the ongoing conversation that we&#8217;re having is something&#8217;s gonna happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. And then there&#8217;s a flat, simple, practical byproduct. All of this is that we&#8217;re having a conversation live and sharing our philosophies, sharing our thoughts, sharing our actions, um, all these things that has another byproduct that could lead us in another direction altogether, which is good. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. You just say from a professional opportunity standpoint,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:53] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> right, exactly. I mean, it&#8217;s the part, being part of the same network overlapping concentric circles. Um, And, uh, and kinda seeing what comes out of it. Cuz the other, I think the other thing I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m thinking in from the perspective of somebody who&#8217;s listening, who&#8217;s like, right, you, you know, you are both established.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You have, you know, other income streams or you&#8217;ve got your networks, you&#8217;ve, you know, and, and you&#8217;re also putting a product out there. Like, I still see people on entrepreneurial forums that are like, you know, somebody&#8217;s gonna steal my idea. And, and we have gone the other direction and, and obviously we&#8217;re not the first, but, um, of, you know, just brazenly putting it out there and taking our sweet time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s be honest. Like if we were other people, if we had venture capital, if we, you know, Didn&#8217;t have, you know, responsibilities and mortgages and things like we&#8217;d eat ramen and we&#8217;d have cranked this thing out years, uh, months ago. And, um, and there&#8217;s absolutely the chance that somebody listens and goes, oh, that&#8217;s a great idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, and comes in and, and, Steals it and releases it before we do. Um, you know, but it&#8217;s still, like you just said, it&#8217;s all part of the journey. We&#8217;re going to put our own twist on it. We&#8217;re going to put our own experience on it and, uh, and continue to iterate on the project, the product too. So when the product does come out, like it&#8217;s very much ours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it might overlap with other people&#8217;s, but frankly it already will. Like, that&#8217;s the nature of. Pretty much any product. There&#8217;s no, there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s really, you know, almost nothing that hasn&#8217;t been invented. Um, and I also, another, uh, thread I saw recently again on, um, I think it was Reddit, one of the entrepreneurial ride along, or, or one of those subreddits, um, That people were concerned about not having an idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And everybody else was like, just you, you don&#8217;t, you know, okay, don&#8217;t, don&#8217;t steal an idea and reproduce it. Like that&#8217;s boring. But you know, if you can build the better mousetrap, if you can build the better to-do list, if you can build the better time tracking app, uh, you know, whatever, do it. Like, that&#8217;s how most.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Competition starts as, as these pretty subtle little differences. Um, and then you listen to your users, you listen to your own gut, and you end up di I feel like you end up diverging more and more and more. Um, you know, and or you&#8217;ve got, you&#8217;ve got a network that, that you can tap into that existing client or existing products can&#8217;t or whatever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, um, You know, it&#8217;s all, I guess I, these days I view it, I view it as kind of as a game, which is more flippant than it probably sounds, but it&#8217;s like you&#8217;re wheeling and dealing, but there&#8217;s times when you win and there&#8217;s times when you lose. God. I&#8217;m being very metaphorical here, but, um, you know, but it&#8217;s the, the.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I view it as an ebb and flow, which is, uh, again, I think for me the, the way that I had to phrase it a while ago was like, this is a hobby. And, uh, and so it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s meant to be fun. Um, and that isn&#8217;t to say that everything we do has to be fun cuz, and, and, or that I don&#8217;t take it seriously, but, um, but it gives you, I think, a little more perspective.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You don&#8217;t have, I don&#8217;t, I don&#8217;t have board members that I have to, or, you know, or stockholders that I have to appease. Um, And I don&#8217;t have, uh, you know, I don&#8217;t have to burn the, the, the candle at both ends, um, to make ends meet if there&#8217;s a bug. And I&#8217;ve got users that are depending on me, that happens with my apps or my plugins once in a while, but it&#8217;s honestly like once in a while.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s fun. I don&#8217;t wanna do it all the time, but it&#8217;s like, oh, I&#8217;ve gotta do a little hackathon and, and you know, figure this out until 2:00 AM cuz a bunch of people are depending on me. That&#8217;s fun too, you know? So,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:45] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Yeah. It occurs to me it&#8217;s really a low pressure and stress for us, which is what we both need.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right. Um, having a little bit more, I mean, I guess that&#8217;s the definition of a hobby, right? You know, enjoyment without the stress and pressure. Yeah. When it switches from hobby. Oftentimes it counts with stress and pressure. Yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:08] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Well, and and it&#8217;s interesting cuz like I, I worked at startups, you know, it&#8217;s like I&#8217;ve done, I&#8217;ve done a lot of work in WordPress, um, and there&#8217;s been a lot of overlap.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I also, for a long time specifically was working for and with and at startups, um, of different natures. Um, and some of it was WordPress work and some of it was not. But there, there, and I was in New York City for a long, long time, um, so-called Silicon Alley. Um, during the WeWork stuff, I think I&#8217;ve mentioned that before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can actually see me in the WeWork movie and, um, and all that. And I was surrounded by people who were hustling all the hustlers and, and all that stuff. And it&#8217;s like, Most people were chipping away. I mean, almost like, like almost anything. It&#8217;s a, everything&#8217;s a bell curve, right? So most of the people on the bell curve were just chipping away, you know, and they weren&#8217;t burning themselves out, but they weren&#8217;t also only working a day a week or something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you had people who were working very, very hard. And you did have people who were there just for the lifestyle and honestly spent all day just playing ping pong. Um, and were there for the beer kegs, you know? Um, But working at different startups, like I&#8217;ve worked at startups where it was all hustle, hustle, hustle, and we&#8217;ve gotta put in long hours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, um, and I, I found that I got out of those pretty quickly in part because I would, would burn out. Um, and I think it would be different if I had been in charge. Um, but like the one main startup where I was CTO was. Um, I think there&#8217;s a cultural difference here. Um, but it was in Nashville. It wasn&#8217;t in New York.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there&#8217;s, um, there two things were different. We were not in the hustle bustle of New York City. Nashville&#8217;s a little more easygoing. Um, but also we were generally all, you know, in our thirties and older, we weren&#8217;t all a type. Hustler entrepreneurs. Um, and then, uh, stereotypically, uh, down south you&#8217;ve got family values are, uh, or at least the family itself is prioritized higher.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so we, there, we absolutely put in some long days, but for the most part it was. A priority of the founder and subsequently everybody else on the team that, you know, you wouldn&#8217;t, if it could be done tomorrow, if it was five or six o&#8217;clock, then fine. Do it tomorrow. You know, keep chipping away, make good progress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, um, you know, but you didn&#8217;t, we didn&#8217;t have to burn ourselves out. Uh, we weren&#8217;t gonna really get anywhere by burning ourselves out. And, and we did just fine till we ran outta money, which happens with startups. Um, you know, but it, but it doesn&#8217;t, it doesn&#8217;t always have to be that crazy atmosphere. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I, I&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:02] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> can&#8217;t help but think there&#8217;s a shift going on globally too, with work.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:07] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Um, what, sorry, what, what was it like at, like, ithe or, you know, some of the, the bigger places you&#8217;ve worked?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:13] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> The biggest place I have been be beyond like liquid web would be, um, I was at a seminary and I think there was 150, 200 people employed by the seminary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe that it&#8217;s too much. No, I actually, there&#8217;s a hundred, 150, um, that, that was just a very academic setting, so it was money, always money. So, Um, I loved it cause it was a learning stuff, but as far as like in the past, um, you know, I worked at newspapers, so it was always deadline. I think it was more startup, you know?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Very much startup. Except every day we were launching a new product.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:58] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> That&#8217;s, that&#8217;s insane.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:00] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Which I think is why I probably liked entrepreneurship is just the deadlines and product is, it was so fulfilling to come. At the end of the day. But as far as values and stuff goes, I think I learned more in my leadership from what the not to do what I didn&#8217;t like, the obsession with whatever the goal was at the expense of people and just realistically, like what are we expecting people to do?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, I could, my truck. Get it all, get it up to 150 miles per hour and get into the red line, then it&#8217;s eventually gonna break. And I don&#8217;t think you can do that. We try to do that with people. Um, but I took a lot of those lessons leadership wise. I had, um, probably some things I go, I&#8217;m not gonna do that ever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My last job before I started iThemes, um, I worked for a really amazing pastor. The one that kind of refreshed my optimism that. There could be one who at the time, the way I understood the Bible was be just a shepherd. You know? Um, he was really awesome. I really, I, I took his archive as a leader into, into I themes or eventually when we grew on our team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you&#8217;re right, the first, first couple years, um, it was just fun and new. It was creating stuff. With hopes and dreams and thoughts and ideas and, uh, it was messy. Um, it was messy, but we got to do some cool stuff. We did like create an office that eventually grew to about 5,000 square feet and got to, like, my dad actually drove up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From about two hours from where he lives from us and came and helped me, helped us demolish some of the walls that were up at this place. Cause we wanted more of that bigger open thing and we went to IKEA and get all the tables. And I think about all that initial time, very romantically, very affectionately, because it was just, we didn&#8217;t all know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We didn&#8217;t know what we were doing. I sure as hell didn&#8217;t know what I was doing, but it was fun creating something that. What would our expression look like? And so I would say for the first three years it was just kinda hanging on and having fun with, yeah, doing some real stuff. Um, there was electricity in the air and uh, with a whole set of problems that developed out of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then I think when we hit about a million in revenue, I couldn&#8217;t manage the team by myself. Um, we were up to at least 10 people by that time and. I think things got more serious and probably professional, um, in the sense of, okay, you know, we, we had health insurance probably I think our first year. As soon as we hired the first couple employees we needed to get health insurance type of thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And uh, but I think that year something was different is like, we&#8217;ve got something here. Yeah. Lining in the bottle. Let&#8217;s figure out how to protect it, grow it. Maintain it. And um, and so we needed some of the structure in there. Um, my value as leader though, was always, like, I did a talk early on. I was like, I wanted to build a tree house.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wanted to have a tree house, and I wanted to invite all these cool people to play with me in the tree house. That&#8217;s what it was the first couple years. And, and some really good stuff came out of that. Um, you know, we didn&#8217;t fall out of the tree house and break her arm. Um, mostly, and then it was, it was shifting of like, holy crap, like look at this thing, we gotta figure out that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, but when it really serious was toward the end when it was like, oh, there was more children of our employees than there were employees, and that was responsibility barrier. And then it&#8217;s like, house gets a little serious, you know? Yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:07] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> That&#8217;s interesting. Um,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:11] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> so yeah, I&#8217;m. I look back at that time very fondly and nostalgically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, cuz I remember it was toward the end of the year. No, it was after the first of the year. And I got invited to be in, uh, entrepreneurs organization and said, well, you need a million in sales. And I remember going to our accountant like in January and going, okay, where do we hit? And we were like, $70 over a million or something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I thought we did it, but here&#8217;s how weird it was. More treehouse thing is like, That money didn&#8217;t flow directly to me. That was, I wasn&#8217;t swimming in the lap of luxury or anything. It was like that childhood c childish feeling of I get the high score on Gallagher. Oh wow. We did it. We did it. You know, and, uh, [00:32:00] but what&#8217;s, what&#8217;s crazy related to the whole entrepreneur journey is I think that was probably, I.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those circumstances and timing and backing into that was just ideal, obviously. But I go, it wasn&#8217;t all luck, right? It was both. It was all luck, all hard work. You know? It was both. Um, cuz I&#8217;ve since then tried to recreate the magic experiment, you know? Yeah. It was cool. My partner came in, I think it was our first year, we had our first office, and I would buy these, sorry, I&#8217;m these plastic tables from Sam&#8217;s Club.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mm-hmm. Basically picnic tables, you know. Yeah. And I was like, these are our desks. I held onto that for the longest time until we got our next office. And Matt was like my co he was like, Time to time to probably upgrade from the white desk. And I was like, no, I don&#8217;t want to. I did eventually. Um, but I think that was part of that magic right time, right place, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>People were partners, right. WordPress. Um, but it, I that those conditions were really conducive to creativity and magic and pulling. People were pull. Pulled in to that, like Christine was one, um, I think it was our second or third team member, man, changed the change, solidified the entire direction of the company and.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, huge, uh, different people like Dusti Bolton, Matt Danner, and Kristen Rutten, and different people that poured into our orbit. I go, wow, this is cool. So like when you talk about band, I go, that&#8217;s what my band was. Mm-hmm. Because it&#8217;s just like, we just made really good music for a long time. Yep. Uh, but how do I recreate that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s been the obsession for the last five years. Uh, until I just go, that was done. That was there. Yeah. That was album. I laid, we laid, excuse me. And it&#8217;s on to new music, right?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:03] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Yeah. Or yeah, arriving at a different thing, different voices. You can&#8217;t just recreate the same thing. Music&#8217;s always the perfect metaphor in, in entrepreneurship, ownership and programming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think there&#8217;s a reason why so many of us are into music or are musicians or whatever. Um, but yeah, and I think that&#8217;s, That&#8217;s what a lot of, like, I, I was really into all the entrepreneur stories for a long time and I&#8217;m glad I listened to a bunch of the podcasts and, you know, and whatnot. But you can&#8217;t recreate somebody else&#8217;s story can be inspired&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:44] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> by for sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:46] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Oh hundred percent. A hundred percent. And, and, and some of it is good advice or, you know, in certain situations you&#8217;re like, oh, you know, I remember this thing. It&#8217;s like, like reading a playbook, but you still have to know what plays to apply or whatever.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:01] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> I, so when I le met Lindsay and in like 2010, which was that year, we hit a million, um, we started this thing that, um, was called Startup Sofa.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:13] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> I&#8217;m sorry, I&#8217;m laughing because you know, you&#8217;re, She&#8217;s clearly in it for the money. Um, you know, yes. That year, you know, you were walking around being like, uh, my company just turned a million. You know what? Beautiful women want, want, want me now? She, she,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:30] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> she remembers. She goes, no, you know, we were dating when.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You hit your first six figure month. And I was like, Uhhuh, I realized everything got better with you. It did. Um, that&#8217;s the other way&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:44] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> she sees it. The she sees it the other way around. Yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:47] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> And it. And honestly, candidly, it did, everything did get better when you just had some like, like while we&#8217;re doing this together, not apart, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s right. It&#8217;s just better together. I&#8217;ve said that with post status. All the other things, it&#8217;s like, God, as much as I want to think I&#8217;m a solo act, I&#8217;m really not. Well, I&#8217;m much better as a collaborator. Um, oh, so we started, I started this thing called Startup Sofa, um, and tried to share all these things I had learned.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was laughing, telling her that, and I said, I was two years into this thing and thought I was, I could share, I do believe there&#8217;s a point where if you&#8217;re like one step, two step ahead of someone, sure it&#8217;s very helpful. It&#8217;s very good stuff. Like this is where I&#8217;ve got, uh, but I started laughing. I go, cuz now I try to share less.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I really actively try to not give advice as best I can until I go, okay, now it&#8217;s time for advice. I just share experiences cuz I go right. Everybody I hear doing that and you&#8217;re like, how long have you been doing this? All right. Have you been doing it exactly the way they have? Do you know their dna N do you know their company?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you know the mix? Do you know the environment? The answer is no. Very few bands lose their cover singer and have can just plug in another person and know, I think Queen is one of them, but you&#8217;re like, it&#8217;s very hard to, the magic is that band, those people that time to&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:12] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> do that. Yeah. Yeah. And I mean, you can&#8217;t, and time is is the other, is the other thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s like you can&#8217;t, you know, I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m stuck in that a little bit with music. It&#8217;s like I am, I am getting better and better at making a genre that basically died 10 years ago. I do it cuz I love it. And again, I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m, there are moments where I&#8217;m like, uh, these other genres are more popular. I would get more airplay if I switch genres again cuz I switched genres.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like I rode a lot, the wave of, a lot of genres for a lot of years and I was sincere about it. I wasn&#8217;t, cuz I, I&#8217;ve never made music thinking that it was really going to get popular or what have you. Um, But now I make the music that I love the most and nothing else has come along that I love more. Um, but, so if you&#8217;re the perfect band, but you&#8217;re making seventies rock, uh, you might have a hard time if it sounds too much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just like seventies rock, you know? Okay. That&#8217;s&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:15] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> so good because then I go, there&#8217;s this other part to the whole magic is that you want magic to happen. Probably some baseline passion, desire, interest for you. Seventies rock music, right? And I go, well, as time goes by, everything works in cycles. We know it might be dead 10 years ago, but it could be alive 10 years from now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you&#8217;re like, oh, it&#8217;s those people that I admire very much, Corey, that have their interests and desires and passions and don&#8217;t. Stop. Mm-hmm. There&#8217;s some little fire of that in what we&#8217;re talking about while we keep showing up on [00:39:00] Wednesdays. But I really admire it because I go, those are the people that, that something is gonna happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s probably gonna be better than what they imagined. Not what they imagined, but better. And, uh, I go to like seventies music. You said it just so organically. It&#8217;s something I, I like probably not gonna stop and then I go, well, if you stay around for another 20 years, Doing that, something&#8217;s gonna happen of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:25] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> right. I mean, that&#8217;s been proven over and over again and it doesn&#8217;t happen for everybody. And I&#8217;m, I have, you know, there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s two thi, two things, only two, there are at least two. One, one is persistence, um, doing what you love. And, but again, this is where, and for me it had to be. Calling it a hobby, you have to make your peace with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that&#8217;s the bigger, uh, the wider way to describe it is like there are people who are session musicians, you know, there are people who are, um, who will try to ride each wave to make the next, you know, hit song based on what trends are now. Um, there are people who would just grind. Um, Derek Sives talks a lot about this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Um, love his work. And, um, you know, and, and, uh, and he&#8217;s a good example. And other people, uh, who are like, okay, well I&#8217;m going to, I&#8217;m gonna do other things to, you know, to pay the bills, but, uh, my passion lies over here. And, uh, because it&#8217;s my passion, it will, I will always keep chipping away at it kind of thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, but I think, so that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s sort of one line. And then there&#8217;s another line, which is time and perspective and, um, Because you talk about good things will happen to them eventually. Right? And so it&#8217;s like I, for me, part of that I think can be the lowering of expectations, uh, which sounds so old and cynical and beaten down, but it&#8217;s like I get more out of.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Smaller things musically, like again, I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m getting older and older. The likelihood that even if I got a song that blew up, am I gonna tour on that at age 46? I also, I generally make music that that&#8217;s popular in England and so am I going to tour in England at age 46 and I can barely stay awake past 10:00 PM Am I, am I really gonna go DJ gigs at three in the morning?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No. You know, uh, and so managing, managing expectations and it&#8217;s like I&#8217;ve, but I, and being content with, uh, a little bit of airplay here and there, or the people who, uh, I&#8217;ve now been friends with for. You know, decades coming to me and saying like, this is the best song you&#8217;ve ever written. I&#8217;m like, that&#8217;s enough.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, I don&#8217;t, you know, yes, I would still love, you know, uh, endless BBC airplay or something, but the li the likelihood is less. And so it&#8217;s the, uh, staying consistent for me. Staying consistent, plugging away, doing what I wanna do, but then also being more and more content with, again, smaller wins. Um, cuz it&#8217;s like there&#8217;s, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, it&#8217;s hard not to like, um, I am reacting to what you just said of like going, there&#8217;s a lot of entrepreneur advice that, that the entrepreneurs that I was following, like for years I wanted to go to, um, Rob Walling and, and Mike, they do startups for the rest of us. Um, and they do a conference, MicroCon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. For years I wanted to go to MicroComp and, and then it, and, and I went to businesses, software, and some of these that were, I. Like only a few of the talks were relevant to the very, very bootstrapping I was doing. Um, and now even MicroComp, I mean, and years ago they split into two tracks. I don&#8217;t know where they are anymore, but the last time I looked, and this is no criticism of them, it&#8217;s just like I never.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I never was able to go up, up, up with all the other people that were going up, up, up. And so then they were all, you know, you, you were, you mentioned being a couple of rungs ahead of me. They were ladders ahead of me. And so it stopped being, um, pertinent. Um, and I also took my foot off the gas and, and aimed a little smaller.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And again, qualifying more the more side hustles and, and you know, uh, and stuff like that. And so it&#8217;s like, I struggle, I go back and forth, right? Pride at the end of my life, I, I would love to have owned a gajillion dollar company, or more importantly to me, honestly, would be to have a gajillion user product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, cuz it&#8217;s just more fun, frankly, and, and presume that money would come out of it and stuff like that. But it&#8217;s like, what are my, what are my actual goals? Like, why at 46 do I code extracurr? I, I, it&#8217;s a hobby. I love it. Okay, but what, what are the goals? You know, are there still goals? Am I still trying to earn millions of dollars?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like what is, it&#8217;s like I always, I always talk about, um, I don&#8217;t know, I, I don&#8217;t actually know anybody who makes canoes, but I always talk about, Uh, the, or I love the idea of a person who, cuz I think I, it&#8217;s the most frivolous thing I can think of. Um, and that&#8217;s that, and I don&#8217;t mean that negatively, but as a hobby, like in your garage, taking up most of your a, a car bay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So one of your cars probably has to be parked in the, in the driveway so that you can make a canoe. I guarantee you don&#8217;t need a canoe. And, and the world doesn&#8217;t need another canoe. There are canoes that you could go buy, probably get one for free because everybody buys a canoe and then never ends up using it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s, at least that was me, my family growing up. Um, but anyway, it&#8217;s like that to me is the epitome of a hobby. It&#8217;s pure love. Absolutely nothing in the world needs or requires or even probably encourages you to build a canoe, but you want to, so you&#8217;re gonna do it. Um, and that&#8217;s, and then I look at, at what I&#8217;m doing and it&#8217;s like, okay, well the, if, you know, the end goal of a canoe is that you can put it in the water and paddle it around, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s like, so the end goal for me, for building a product is users as people, users it. And I&#8217;m like, look, I, I brought value or joy or productivity or, you know, something that it&#8217;s validating. Um, You know, but, but in the grand scheme of things, like there was a time when I was like, you know, the goal is to make a gajillion dollars.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, now it&#8217;s like I&#8217;ve, I&#8217;ve gotten, I&#8217;ve gotten smaller and smaller and smaller. Now it&#8217;s to make a good product that people use. Mm-hmm. And it&#8217;s like, is that because I have failed so many times that my expectations have gone down, down, down, or. Is that still I&#8217;ve, I&#8217;ve, for myself, I have distilled it down to, that&#8217;s the first real spark, and then you kind of grow a, ideally grow a fire from there, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve got people using something, then you&#8217;ve got something, presumably, and then that&#8217;s where you, you know, uh, You are, you are the fuel, and I&#8217;m the f I&#8217;m the spark or whatever, you know, that&#8217;s where you and I collaborate because fire takes three things. Um, and so you, you can&#8217;t, you probably can&#8217;t do it yourself or you don&#8217;t want to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and, or, you know, the idea of cool people working together to build something bigger and bigger and bigger. And so part of the joy is like, I was texting my, talking about the, the startup in Nashville. I was texting with the ceo. Yes. This weekend, you know, and I haven&#8217;t, and that was at least 10 years ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s like friendships that last, or fond memories or, or war stories or, you know, I don&#8217;t know. It&#8217;s hard to, I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m totally rambling, but it&#8217;s hard to quantify now, harder to quantify now for me, like. Why on earth I do this, but I do it and it brings me joy and maybe that&#8217;s all I need.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:47:30] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Yeah. We&#8217;ve talked a lot about hobbies and historically I&#8217;ve been like, I don&#8217;t have hobbies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have work, I don&#8217;t have a home life. Um, and work was always my hobby. I mean, I would say even before I, I could, I had so much fun. It was like a hobby, I guess. Mm-hmm. Um, and most of the business was fun and I didn&#8217;t. Have time and want to have time for other hobbies. Like it had to be productive. When you said hobby, it&#8217;s like when you&#8217;re talking about the canoe, I go, there&#8217;s a reason the person has makes space in the garage and the significant other probably goes, we don&#8217;t have any garage cause the canoe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I go, that energy, that passion needs to take up space in your life somehow. And I go, so I haven&#8217;t had those. I do have two motorcycle, um, two motorcycles and the girls that don&#8217;t work. Um, but like what takes up space? I guess I was thinking what takes up space and this is it, this is part of this. So like we talked about it and your, your thoughts and hobbies have helped me so much more as go, I still think about it as.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For some reason, I, it&#8217;s hard for me to do something just for the value of doing it. The joy of doing it. Yeah. Um, I do have joy in doing things that build. I just want the practical something to the end. But I go, you know, this has, this, this time should take, uh, space in my life because I enjoy it. Right for that only value.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s something that did not exist probably a year ago, five years ago. 10 years ago. In my, in my mind, in my heart, because I was like, well, it&#8217;s just extra. It does take up just like the canoe in the garage takes up space, that other things could be there, but I go. No, enjoy talking to you. Enjoy having these conversations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enjoy tinkering with these products. This is our little mm-hmm. Garage hobby. You know, my version because I don&#8217;t physical things, you know, you build fences and stuff. Um, I, I don&#8217;t really do a lot of that. Don&#8217;t feel like I have always the ability and patience to do it, but I was like, hobby that builds, I, that&#8217;s my version of hobby is something, even when I could say I.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My reading hobby, my hiking hobby, for me, it still builds. I&#8217;d need that part. It&#8217;s just, it connects somewhere back. Um, like I can say we&#8217;re gonna my daughter and sent her home. Of course summer, we&#8217;ll go to the swimming pool. The value of that is rest and recuperation and enjoying time with them. That checks by something that builds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure. Thing, but I don&#8217;t know. As you were talking, I was like, no, it&#8217;s this time should take up this space. It has taken up, what, the last six months I think we&#8217;re our 18th session.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:50:40] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Yeah. I, yeah. I love, I love that you say it that way, like I think the hard part is, again, settling it in your own mind and then explaining it to other people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. And, and I know that we&#8217;ve struggled a little bit, um, where to my wife, it looks like I&#8217;m working all the time and I&#8217;m like, yeah. And sometimes I am. And sometimes it&#8217;s work, but it&#8217;s not earning me any money. And sometimes it&#8217;s fun and it&#8217;s not earning me any money. And it&#8217;s, you know, and it&#8217;s like there are four, the four quadrants of earns money or doesn&#8217;t, and it&#8217;s fun or it isn&#8217;t, but, um, and it&#8217;s client work or it&#8217;s not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, and I know that like my folks struggle with this too. My dad, my folks are retired, but my dad still writes papers, um, using research that he did during his career as a forester. Um, And it just brings him joy. And my mom&#8217;s like, get off the damn computer, where, you know, go play golf. We&#8217;re retired.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s not the retirement she wants. It&#8217;s the retirement he wants, you know? Um, and so it&#8217;s the hard, sometimes it&#8217;s hard to explain or show to other people, like, this is okay, this is what I wanna do. It&#8217;s like, as long as you&#8217;re getting enough exercise in vitamin D, you know, uh, but it&#8217;s, you know, cuz it&#8217;s, And it&#8217;s funny cuz people will look at gaming, you know, it&#8217;s like, oh, well you&#8217;re, you&#8217;re 10, 12 hours a day in front of the TV going zap, zap, zap or whatever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know? We&#8217;ll go, okay, that&#8217;s fi that&#8217;s fine. That&#8217;s a hobby. It&#8217;s like, It may or may not be the healthiest me sitting here typing, building something, and I&#8217;m not judging one against the other, obviously, but it&#8217;s the, like, it&#8217;s hard to, it&#8217;s, it, it&#8217;s not as easy to demonstrate that it&#8217;s the same sort of thing of like, no, this is fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:52:35] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Oh yeah. I, you know, self-care is all in the rage and I&#8217;m glad it is, but I go, it&#8217;s such an abstract concept for me. But because I&#8217;m, I try to be pretty practical with things, but I go, you know, that time and space is valuable to me. And you put the other part, is it seen as valued by others? And that&#8217;s another conversation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I go, what I&#8217;m trying to do is like, I don&#8217;t have those things. Maybe I don&#8217;t consciously have those things a take up space that I go, this is me, this is for me. Right. It&#8217;s for others but me and this whole concept of taking, so I says, what the heck does that talk about? It means for me personally, being in a line, not worrying about everybody else, necessarily worrying about me too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m okay to be in this space. Um, there&#8217;s a great person on Instagram talking about, or Instagram talking about Enneagram, and I&#8217;m an Enneagram nine, which is peacemaker Art Tap. And the one thing they said, take up space. And I said, I think I&#8217;m starting to get that now from canoe in the garage to standing in line.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you know what? I&#8217;m in this part and I&#8217;m gonna take this particular space, you know, for myself. Yeah. And I think that goes back to hobbies is now of course communication with sniff and others and all that stuff. But I go, it&#8217;s one added element I think our conversations have been so enriching for me is just go, it&#8217;s okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This time our async time takes up space and what I increasingly see is limited time. Yeah. And energy. But I go, I wanted to take up space. I wanted to take up that space. And you know, that&#8217;s the amber that I think keeps me coming to this. Uh, and then, you know, you never know. You just never know. Yep. Like we&#8217;re not losing our house families, all this stuff, like you said earlier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yep. So good reflection on a Wednesday.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:54:48] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> So, uh, I think both of us have limited availability for a while, but as we&#8217;ve said so I&#8217;m the only thing that is tugging at my sleeve. Given, given the reflection that we&#8217;ve just done, like I&#8217;m, I would be okay if time went by. Um, but the, the little bit that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s nagging at me is that we&#8217;re, we are really close.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like I have something working. Um, and so I think that that&#8217;s gonna keep, that&#8217;s gonna drive me soon to, again, start putting in a few hours here and there, um, to try to get something. Out the door, um, for you to use. For me to use and mm-hmm. Um, and you know, as quick as we can get it on the website. And, and so it&#8217;s on, it&#8217;s for sale.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, and there it is. People can try it. And, and you know, um, we were&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:55:55] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> talking about our, don&#8217;t think feature damages post says that are gonna, we got this new theme in staging. We&#8217;re gonna be launching before work camps. I&#8217;ll say July 1st, and realizing thumbnails on the feature, damage on the archive pages, uh, how we&#8217;re gonna do the feature damages in the post gonna need to change as an awareness thing from the post edit client side.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I go, this is gonna be good, you know, we&#8217;ll keep iterating on this. Um, with when, when you&#8217;re able to get the new update. Is, um, I think there&#8217;d be a lot of good feedback there, um, to how does that look on that home? How does that look on the inside page? That I think is that cornerstone to value for, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I like to say, I think it&#8217;s good timing when you get the new update, put it on staging, start trying it out. We&#8217;ll have another round of feedback.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:56:52] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Yeah, exactly. Exactly. So yeah, baby steps or big steps sometimes, you know. Yeah. But. Keep moving forward. Sounds good.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:57:04] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> All right.

Keep your profile up-to-date and manage your online identity by adding verified links to the services you use, such as Instagram, Tumblr, GitHub, Mastodon, and more. Adding multiple payment options to your profile builds trust that those paying you know they have the correct account.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gravatar is your personal digital business card. And now a one-stop place for those that need to send you payments.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-buttons is-vertical is-content-justification-center is-layout-flex wp-container-1 wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button has-custom-width wp-block-button__width-50 is-style-fill\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-base-color has-text-color wp-element-button\" href=\"https://gravatar.com/profiles/edit#about-you\">Edit Your Profile</a></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-button has-custom-width wp-block-button__width-50 is-style-fill\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link wp-element-button\" href=\"http://gravatar.com/connect/?source=gravatar_blog\">Claim Your New Gravatar</a></div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 21 Jun 2023 18:31:58 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Ronnie Burt\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:\"type\";i:128;s:7:\"headers\";O:48:\"WpOrg\\Requests\\Utility\\CaseInsensitiveDictionary\":1:{s:7:\"\0*\0data\";a:8:{s:6:\"server\";s:5:\"nginx\";s:4:\"date\";s:29:\"Tue, 11 Jul 2023 05:54:42 GMT\";s:12:\"content-type\";s:8:\"text/xml\";s:13:\"last-modified\";s:29:\"Tue, 11 Jul 2023 05:30:29 GMT\";s:4:\"vary\";s:15:\"Accept-Encoding\";s:15:\"x-frame-options\";s:10:\"SAMEORIGIN\";s:16:\"content-encoding\";s:4:\"gzip\";s:4:\"x-nc\";s:9:\"HIT ord 1\";}}s:5:\"build\";s:14:\"20230615065637\";}', 'no');

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>( Intro music )</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:00:39]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have with me Alex Kirk, who is a longtime WordPress contributor and who has been instrumental in recent innovations in the Polyglots&#8217; work. Phase four of the Gutenberg project is native multilingual support, and so I see this work that is being done as instrumental, not only for our global community but in support of what&#8217;s to come in that specific roadmap.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:00:59]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So without further ado, Alex Kirk, welcome to the WordPress Briefing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:01:03]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hello, how are you doing?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:01:05]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m good. I&#8217;m good. Can you, let&#8217;s, because I bet that not a lot of people know who you are, can you first start by just telling me a bit about your work with WordPress, and then let us know what GlotPress is, for those of us who don&#8217;t know yet?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:01:19]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. So, Automattic sponsors me to work in the WordPress project on the Meta team and on the Polyglots team. So I spent time on improving or helping improve the software that powers the translation on WordPress.org. But I also work on the meta team on things like Matrix and evaluating if it would be a good fit for WordPress to switch to Matrix for their chat system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:01:46]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So a lot of really big projects that you work on, all of that kind of stuff that has no easy solutions anymore, is where you are right now. Huh?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:01:56]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, there&#8217;s no clear path, but it&#8217;s our mission to find it. So that&#8217;s part of what makes things interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:02:05]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cool. So for folks who don&#8217;t know too much about the Polyglots team or generally translating WordPress, the software, can you let us know a bit about what GlotPress is?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:02:16]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right. So the translation system that powers WordPress.org is called GlotPress. It used to be a standalone software that was developed a couple of years ago, and it was transformed into a WordPress plugin at some point, and now powers the translation that happens on WordPress.org. So we translate WordPress core there from English to other languages, plugins, themes, block patterns, and it all happens through this software called GlotPress. There are a couple GlotPress installations around the world, but I think the WordPress.org one is one of the bigger ones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:02:55]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Probably, WordPress.org is pretty, pretty massive. Also, I think it&#8217;s great that you said that GlotPress was created a couple of years ago, like that, that indicates to me that you&#8217;re working on a really different timescale than a lot of folks are in WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:03:10]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So Alex, tell me a little bit about what it takes to ship translated WordPress software. So, I mean, for people who don&#8217;t need translated WordPress, like obviously we don&#8217;t have a good idea of what it takes to make sure that WordPress is available in so many languages. So what goes into the work of making sure that that happens?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:03:32]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right, so typically the WordPress software and plugins and themes are primarily created in English. And for it to be available in other languages, it needs to be translated. And for that to be able to happen, the programmers need to make the software translatable. Basically, they&#8217;re providing each English string for the translation software to be available to be transformed, so to speak, into another language and to what it&#8217;s being transformed to. This is what the translators do. So they go into the GlotPress software and see the list of texts that need to be translated and translate it to their language that they speak. Typically there is a process around this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:03:32]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, we&#8217;ve got people who have lots of experience in translation. And specifically in translating WordPress or WordPress plugins. And they&#8217;re kind of the, the people who help ensure good quality of translation. So anybody who&#8217;s working the WordPress project, so basically who has a WordPress.org account, can come in and address the translation. And that translation enters the system, so to speak, in a waiting state. And then somebody who we promoted to be a Translation Editor will come along and take a look at your translation and will approve it or will give you suggestions how to do the translation in a better way, or come up with maybe even a better translation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:05:03]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, when you have like a small thing that&#8217;s just not right, like a missing full stop or something like that. They might just add it for you. And well, as soon as the plugin or software is translated to a certain level of translations those translations will be shipped out to the WordPress installs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:05:20]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, for example, for a plugin, you would reach 90% of translated strings. Those translations will then be basically packed up into zip file, a language pack and delivered to each WordPress so that you can have the translations available there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:05:35]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And is 90% the threshold for plugins only, or is that also the threshold for like themes and the CMS itself?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:05:34]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well. We strive for 100%, I would say.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:05:47]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Good. <em>( laughs )</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:05:48]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, 90% more of a motivational point. To be actually honest, I&#8217;m not sure if the threshold is 90% for every project or even if it&#8217;s actually 90%. It&#8217;s different between different GlotPress installations and it&#8217;s basically something that is made as a setting that can be changed. There&#8217;s, it&#8217;s an arbitrary number. Typically you&#8217;d actually want to make sure that the most important strings are translated first. So the ones like, if you look at the whole picture, software usually consists of many parts, many of whom are not encountered by people on a regular basis. For example, error messages that could be like obscure error messages, and you could argue that those might be not as important. Or even sometimes you could even say like, do they need to be translated? Because if you encounter an error message and you search the internet, wouldn&#8217;t you probably want everybody to search for the English one to find the solution? But that set-aside, it&#8217;s important to have like the headline of the plugin or like the most important strings translated, and typically translating those most important strings will take you to a pretty high percentage so that we can then say it&#8217;s good enough to be shipped.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:07:02]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gotcha. I see, I see. Okay. Well, we talked a bit earlier about GlotPress&#8217;s timeline. It has been around for a bit, I know. But with that kind of in mind, have there been any notable changes to GlotPress recently?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:07:19]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, so I think for GlotPress there&#8217;s been a bit of an up and down over time in terms of engagement and progress on the software. But in, in the recent year, I think we&#8217;ve added a couple of things that have been very helpful for translators. So one of them was adding the commenting functionality, so yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:07:35]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Super helpful. Shocked it wasn&#8217;t there before. Sorry, translators. Sorry, all of our polyglots.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:07:40]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, it can be like there was when GlotPress was created there, there is like the, a big part of GlotPress are these states, like the waiting state when you enter translation, and then there&#8217;s approved state, which basically a translation we say it&#8217;s set to current, and there&#8217;s all sorts of process around it. So if the software is updated or translation might get fuzzy. But also like, if somebody submits a translation that doesn&#8217;t fully conform to what&#8217;s the translation editors, or like what the standards of the translation community have been set to, then you would have to need to reject it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:08:16]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that has been something that we felt wasn&#8217;t a very good and enticing way of telling people like, we appreciate your work. It wasn&#8217;t just quite right, but it&#8217;s more of a rejection. So this is how we came up with this like, let&#8217;s give people the option to say what was wrong and give them a chance to try again without making them feel rejected.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:08:38]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Sort of a &#8220;No, but&#8230;&#8221; as opposed to a, just refusal to receive it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:08:45]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And other things that we&#8217;ve worked on is, like, with the recent search of AI, like getting help from AI on translation and also on reviews. So, there&#8217;s some interesting things that you can do with AI in that regard; that one important aspect of translations, it&#8217;s also that we&#8217;ve got glossaries for each language where people, basically the translation community, identifies certain words they want to translate them the same way every time.&nbsp;And with the AI, you can basically add to the prompt, like, please translate those words to those translations when you give me a translation for that. And as it can change over time, you can always adapt this to the prompt, and that has been proven quite helpful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:09:25]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is great. That&#8217;s one of those things I know that AI has been like a really popular thing to talk about. And AI, specifically for translations, I think has caused some concern that maybe we&#8217;ll just like translate it all and hope that computers get it right when we know pretty certainly that computers don&#8217;t always get the translations right. But that&#8217;s not what you&#8217;re talking about, right? What you&#8217;re suggesting is that AI would suggest what could be translated and what it could be translated to, and then human beings have to confirm that that&#8217;s correct, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:09:59]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s exactly it. So basically, we give suggestions to the translators, and then they can modify a translation before they press save. It&#8217;s more of a, like supporting them in getting the translations, like looking up words more quickly and all of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:10:16]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s wonderful. So is that the major sort of next step that is coming for GlotPress, or are there other things that we should keep an eye out for in that software?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:10:27]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So one direction that we&#8217;ve been taking GlotPress is basically making use of the fact that GlotPress is WordPress plugin now. And you know, typically, you would just use a GlotPress install. So on WordPress.Org, there&#8217;s like GlotPress installed, there&#8217;s translation projects created, something that we call &#8220;translation sets&#8221;. So for languages, you want to translate it to, it&#8217;s all pre-configured, and if you would install GlotPress to plugin on your own WordPress, it would be empty and not very useful. So what we&#8217;ve added is a way for you to basically be able to translate the plugins and themes that you&#8217;ve got installed in your WordPress into the language that you&#8217;re interested in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:11:07]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you might have a non-English website that you want to use certain plugins with, and they might not be fully translated at this point, so obviously, you could go to WordPress.org and help translate them, and that&#8217;s the way to, that&#8217;s preferred. But you could also now go install GlotPress on your own website and translate there. And then you have the translations there right when you enter them. And you can then contribute those translations back to WordPress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:11:35]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s with local GlotPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:11:37]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s something that we call local GlotPress. And you know, since we then have all these translations in the local database, it means we can do even more with those translations. So typically, language packs would be delivered to WordPress, but with local GlotPress, you&#8217;ve got like all the GlotPress software there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:11:56]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we can do things like inline translation. So, on your own WordPress and wp-admin, for example, we can highlight all the strings that can be translated, and those strings just have to right-click them and enter your translation, and that way, you can basically go about and translate the whole ui, seeing your progress, as you&#8217;re making, basically turning the screen from red to green.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:12:20]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Yeah. So that&#8217;s something now that you can do in your local WordPress installation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:12:26]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Basically, it&#8217;s completely independent of WordPress.org. We would ask you to contribute the translations back when you have them, but being independent also allows you to translate like premium plugins, which could not be hosted on WordPress.org or doing something like that we call like hyper-local translation. So, for example, I speak Austrian German natively, but even inside Austria, we&#8217;ve got different dialects or like special words that we use. And if I wanted to create a website that&#8217;s targeted at the Viennese market, for example, I might want to use those specific terms. And this is something I would have to argue for those translations to be accepted on WordPress.org because it&#8217;s a, it&#8217;s like a very targeted market. But if I have a local GlotPress, I can do those translations there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:13:11]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That seems awfully beneficial, especially as dialects. I&#8217;ve been having these conversations. I have, in my extended family, many children, and they are all learning languages and one of them has been having kind of thoughts about, like, dialects and how dialects are almost another language. And if so, like how do you know what everybody&#8217;s saying when you&#8217;re speaking all the same thing, but it&#8217;s kind of a little bit it sounds a little bit different.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:13:37]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s certainly a thing in the US, the distinct dialects across our country. And so I imagine that that&#8217;s gonna be a really beneficial sort of implementation for countries that have a lot of different regional variations and certainly smaller countries that have technically the same language as somebody else, but a lot of regional differences, regional specific things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:14:01]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is that the same or different as the live translations, Translate Live, that we talked about at the WordCamp Europe a couple weeks back?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:14:12]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right. So, Translate Live is kind of the next step after local GlotPress. It&#8217;s like this happy marriage between the WordPress Playground and local GlotPress. So the WordPress Playground is also something that has come up a lot. It&#8217;s basically a way for you to run WordPress inside a browser window, so in JavaScript. And at first, it seems like mildly interesting, I would say. But when you combine it with other things like local GlotPress, it can lead to really interesting opportunities. So with inline translation, for example, on WordPress.org, you would typically find for every plugin, the UI would look the same. You would have a table of strings, and all that makes you realize you&#8217;re translating this certain plugin is that in the header of the page, it says this name of the plugin, but other than that, it can look really all the same.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:15:07]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now, with WordPress Playground, you can put up a WordPress and run this plugin inside that Playground. And now, if you add local GlotPress to the picture, you can also do the inline translation of that plugin inside the WordPress Playground. So you&#8217;ve got inline translation. We add the glossary so they do make sure that you translate things the same way that they&#8217;re expected, and you don&#8217;t have to install the plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:15:33]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And still, you can see what the translations will look like. You can see the strings next to each other, and what I think is most important, you will start with the strings that you see first, which are the most important ones. When you&#8217;re in the table view, those strings might be somewhere buried in the middle, and yeah, it&#8217;s really hard to see progress if you start with kind of obscure error messages, for example, versus just starting with the things that you see first.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:16:02]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. So, moving translations away from table-based translations where you kind of have to know what you&#8217;re looking for. So the Translate Live, along with local GlotPress, along with WP Playground, is going to make it so that it&#8217;s easier to see visually what needs to be translated, where, what&#8217;s most valuable to translate for your mid users and your end users, basically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:16:30]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That, and also like for plug-in authors, it can be really good to see, you know, you can switch the languages in the Playground to another language, and you can quickly see like what&#8217;s the state of the translation in this language or in that language. And even things like, you know, Arabic as an RTL language rights to left language. The sidebar will change to the right, and you can also just switch language and see like, what&#8217;s my plugin like in this environment. I mean, this is not technically something that&#8217;s related to local GlotPress, but in this translation live ui, it&#8217;s very easy to change languages and see your plugin in another language.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:17:06]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, it&#8217;s not specifically related to, to Translations Live, but also, I think that if we&#8217;re saying that WordPress not necessarily is going to lead the way with translations and native multilingual support in our CMS because, of course, it&#8217;s still a little bit far out on our roadmap. We certainly have an opportunity to have the best implementation of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:17:27]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And even if like that specific use case that you&#8217;re talking about isn&#8217;t related directly to what it is that you are working on for Polyglots and inside GlotPress and all of that, I do see that having more streamlined, more easy to see and access opportunities to like test the way that our software looks across varying environments, especially those that change it substantially from what we typically work in day-to-day for any individual developer or any individual WordPress site implementer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:18:00</strong>]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, I think that that is a big step forward for all of us and certainly for anyone who is having to use WordPress as not a native English speaker. And so you say it&#8217;s not related, but it still is a big, a big benefit for WordPress overall, I think, to have this kind of work happening so that we can have those benefits to the folks who are using our software.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:18:22]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there were a couple of different things that you mentioned over the course of our conversation. We&#8217;re gonna put some links to the show notes for all of those. But one thing that you mentioned that just kind of went by, and we never really had an opportunity to talk about it. You talked about the, I think it was GTEs, Global Translation Editors, the folks that are like approved as final approvers of translations. If there is someone who&#8217;s listening to this podcast who wants to become a GTE someday, where would they go to do that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:18:54]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the path to GTE is a PTE.&nbsp;<em>( laughs )</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:18:59]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, we&#8217;ve got different levels of translation editors. Basically, you start, you could say you start off as a translator, and this is how you can kind of show that you can do good translations or that you&#8217;re very firm in your language. And this might make you be noticed in the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:19:16]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we&#8217;re always looking for people who like to help with translations. And you might be then promoted to be a Project Translation Editor. Basically, it means that for a single language in a project, you&#8217;ll be able to approve translations. So, you&#8217;ll be the one who says, like, this translation is a good one and this conforms to the to the rules that we have stated as a translation community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:19:42]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And further down the path then is the GTE, where you basically are allowed to approve translations across any project on translate.WordPress.org in your language. And that&#8217;s, usually you&#8217;ll be in, in that position with other GTEs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:20:04]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there is, like, in each community, there is like, we&#8217;re people based. We talk about what might be a good translation. We talk to each other, try to find rules that maybe prevent common mistranslations, or set the standards for how we want the software to be translated. And this is something where you get a voice as a translator, but as a GTE, you get into a position where you can actually make the changes or find consensus on how the software should be translated in your language.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:20:35]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if folks are not familiar where the Polyglots team works and meets, where would they find you all?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:20:41]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>At make.WordPress.org/polyglots.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:20:45]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perfect. Alex, this has been such a fascinating conversation. Thank you so much for joining me today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:20:50]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you very much.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>( Intermission music )</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:20:59]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that brings us now to our small list of big things. First, WP Campus 2023 is taking place July 12th through the 14th. That&#8217;s a nonprofit three-day conference with topics that focus on the growth of higher education, accessibility, WordPress, and anyone who works in higher education.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:21:17]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a hybrid event. There is an in-person component on the beautiful campus of Tulane University in New Orleans, Louisiana. I&#8217;ll add information about that in our show notes for anyone who would like to join in person or online.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:21:32]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing is that the mentorship program pilot that I have been talking about a little bit over the last few months has been formally launched.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:21:39]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are interested in contributing more to the project but not sure where to begin, take a look at this comprehensive onboarding experience. It&#8217;s cohort-based. It has some personalized one-to-one mentorship. There are guided courses, live workshops, all of that.

And so stop by and add your thoughts there in the comments.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:22:38]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is your small list of big things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:22:42]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing.

Her parents gave her own WordPress website to use, play, test, and try whatever she wanted with it. Her health issues had started when she was eight years old, and being able to express who she was and learn new skills provided an escape she needed. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">My first encounter with WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Allison said: &#8220;While the technical aspects of my new WordPress website intrigued me, I was more interested in the space it made for me to write. All throughout my childhood I had struggled with chronic pain, fatigue, and other unexplained symptoms. Having a private world I could call my own, I was able to write my story.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>&#8220;There is something truly amazing about having a place to tell your story.&#8221;</p>\n<cite>Allison Dye</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Her family faced many doctors, nurse, specialists and hospital visits, but could not get an answer to the difficulties faced by Allison. She said: &#8220;I felt like my life and world were out of control. But logging onto my little website and typing away on the computer keys gave me a sense of control. I couldn’t always do things that other kids had the energy to do. But I could get lost in writing for hours. I couldn’t control my life story, but I could write about it.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She felt it was like writing letters to her future self and would act as a reminder of how strong she had become. Even now when Allison writes on her website, she feels it is writing letters to her past self, expressing reassurance and pride. The practice of writing online continues to help her reflect on how she coped and made it through the difficulties.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">WordPress in the real world</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Allison hoped her early experiences with hospitals and being unwell was just part of being a child, and that in adulthood she would be healthy. She longed for this time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Growing up did not bring her this dream of a healthier life and an end to chronic pain. In fact, her condition worsened as she went through her teens and at 18 she finally received a diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/06/allison-2.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Allison stood in front of trees\" class=\"wp-image-15290\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/06/allison-2.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/06/allison-2.jpg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/06/allison-2.jpg?w=900&amp;ssl=1 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Allison enjoying time with nature and trees</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This changed what had been conventional job choices, as she was not able to handle a 9 to 5 work schedule. She could not drive herself to work on some days and relied on her mother to help with transport. She knew that she would have to find another way to work and she was determined to find it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She began writing music and book reviews online, and then moved onto writing blog posts. As they were published she started to receive payment and a sense of power over her life. She said: &#8220;WordPress felt familiar, typing on the computer keys felt comfortable, and sharing my words with the world felt surreal.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Allison&#8217;s sense of ownership of the software became part of her strength. &#8220;I think I believed WordPress was mine somehow. I was learning that WordPress is something that belongs to everyone in some way. And I loved it.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Finding work with WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The confidence using the platform gave Allison led her to find more about what it could do and meet other people who used it. She said: &#8220;The thing I love about WordPress is that it’s not just for developers or bloggers or SEO experts. I began to meet more people in the community and was delighted to find people like me, who didn’t know the technical stuff, but were a part of WordPress.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This global community orbiting around the software gave her an opportunity to meet social media managers, designers, and people from many different areas. She found that &#8216;there was a place for everyone&#8217;. The guiding strength and fascination Allison found and still finds today is in that community. Allison said: &#8220;The community felt as important as the rest of everything that makes WordPress what it is. It felt like it was about people and relationships as well as codes and databases.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2020, she was hired by a WordPress company. She said: &#8220;I like being a part of a WordPress company, and I love that I contribute to a team that helps people with their websites. I understand the importance of having a space that’s yours. Whether it’s a business or personal site, having a website gives you the power of telling your own story.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress gave Allison a freedom and an independence. She did not have to work a 9 to 5 job, rely on others to drive her on bad days with her MS, nor worry about days when she wanted to stay in her sweatshirts rather than go into an office to work. She said: &#8220;I have a 100% remote job which I can do despite the plot twists in my story, thanks to WordPress and the people in it.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress took Allison into the world of project management for a small agency, and this experience was to help guide her path, skills and confidence into the future. She went on to work in content management in WordPress, building pages for awareness campaigns for non profit organizations and small businesses as a contractor. She helps people update their websites, add and edit content, perform basic updates and help them to learn how to use their sites. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>&#8220;I tell all my clients to use WordPress because there is really no other solution that can scale as easily for growing organizations and small businesses. I love how WordPress allows them to tell their stories, share their passion, and have a place to call their own on the internet.&#8221;</p>\n<cite>Allison Dye</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>As a fluent English and Italian speaker, Allison is able to support clients in different countries from where she lives. &#8220;I love that with WordPress I&#8217;m able to support clients remotely. This is thanks to all of the many WordPress contributors, developers, project managers, content writers, and many, many volunteers that work tirelessly to enable people around the world to use WordPress.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Allison also became a certified as an English As A Second Language (ESL) teacher. &#8220;My affinity for words and languages allows me to teach passionately and creatively. I’m Italian-American and am fluent in English and Italian. Teaching English allows me to share my passion for communication with others.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Welcomed into the WordPress community</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"562\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/06/WPCoffeeTalk-Allie-Dye.png?resize=1024%2C562&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Allie interviewed for a podcast on her use of WordPress\" class=\"wp-image-15293\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/06/WPCoffeeTalk-Allie-Dye.png?resize=1024%2C562&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/06/WPCoffeeTalk-Allie-Dye.png?resize=300%2C165&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/06/WPCoffeeTalk-Allie-Dye.png?resize=768%2C422&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/06/WPCoffeeTalk-Allie-Dye.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Allie interviewed for a podcast on her use of WordPress</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Allison attributes mentors and supporters in the WordPress community for helping her appreciate she really is part of it. Allison recalled: &#8220;It felt unreal. I wasn’t a dev, I don’t know how to code, and yet I got to be a part of it all? I felt like I was a fake. But Kimberly continues to remind me that I’m real, I get to be here, I get to stay, I have a place.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She was later encouraged to contribute by a WordPress community member to the Big Orange Heart, which aims to support and promote positive well-being and mental health within remote working communities. She said she felt &#8216;honored typing my words, pieces of my story, and sharing them with a community of people&#8217;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She also joined the <a href=\"https://us.wordcamp.org/2021/\">WordCamp US 2021</a> online organizing team. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Allison enjoys the fact that in the WordPress community, &#8216;everyone here is constantly working to be better and do better&#8217;.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Facing the future with strength from her friends and colleagues in WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"675\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/06/allison-1.jpg?resize=675%2C900&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-15289\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/06/allison-1.jpg?w=675&amp;ssl=1 675w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/06/allison-1.jpg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 675px) 100vw, 675px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Allison was later diagnosed with two additional neurological conditions: Functional Neurological Disorder and Migraine. She said: &#8220;If it were not for WordPress I would really be unable to work. But WordPress and its community continue to be a part of my life and I am grateful to everyone who&#8217;s helped me along my way. I don&#8217;t know where I would even be without it.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She strives to raise awareness of dynamic disabilities and invisible illnesses like her own through podcasts and social media.

00:00:10]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hello, everyone, and welcome to the WordPress Briefing, the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project, some insight into the community that supports it, and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your guest host Chloé Bringmann. And here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>(Intro music)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Chloé Bringmann 00:00:40]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I have the privilege of guest hosting this episode of the WordPress Briefing. And today I have with me a very special guest. The Head of Programs and Contributor Experience, Angela Jin. Welcome. Before we dive into all the questions, can you tell me and our listeners a little bit about your role in the WordPress community?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:01:01]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, happy to, and thank you so much for having me. I&#8217;m very excited to be here. I am the Head of Programs and Contributor Experience, and I provide oversight and guidance for our WordPress programs, such as our events programs, training, and Five for the Future, with an eye toward ensuring their sustainability and growth. I&#8217;m very fortunate to work with our contributors across many teams around the world. In addition to troubleshooting and helping folks figure out how to move forward, I also spend a good amount of time exploring with others what could be in our programs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Chloé Bringmann 00:01:41]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We just got back from WordCamp Europe in Athens, Greece. It was such an energizing event for me, but I&#8217;m curious about what your impressions were of the past week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:01:52]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, it was fantastic. I&#8217;m always really inspired by what a group of like-minded people can achieve together. There&#8217;s a lot of passion for this particular WordCamp, and it made for a really wonderful WordPress experience. Full of lots of great connections and memories; I have a million follow-ups and probably even more thoughts to reflect on. So it&#8217;s great. There were a lot of new WordPressers there. So it was lovely to meet them. And I&#8217;m really excited to see how many exciting new projects and ideas that we have in the space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Chloé Bringmann 00:02:27]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Same, you said it perfectly. Josepha also mentioned in the flagship’s keynote, the proposal for the next generation of WordCamps. I&#8217;m curious about what the main ideas and goals, as discussed thus far, are of that proposal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:02:42]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For sure. So WordCamps have been fundamental for the WordPress community for a very long time. And while they have continued to grow larger and reach more places around the world, it&#8217;s also undeniable that the way that people meet has changed since 2006.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:03:01]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, just as WordPress itself iterates we&#8217;re looking at iterating on WordCamps so that they move from fundamental to indispensable for the WordPressers of today and tomorrow. So event attendees today are looking to learn essential skills, make connections that lead to neat opportunities, and more.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:03:23]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So to that end, we put forth an updated purpose for our events, which is that WordPress events spark innovation and adoption by way of accessible training and networking for users, builders, designers, and extenders. We celebrate community by accelerating 21st-century skills, professional opportunities, and partnerships for WordPressers of today and tomorrow.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:03:47]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the goal here is to create events that are more clearly defined &#8211; who these are for what you will gain from attending. We are looking to see events that take a deeper dive into content, or topics and provide more advanced content. And let&#8217;s try out some different formats and see how that shapes our event experience. And so it is a big shift. And change is always hard.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:04:13]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the feedback that I&#8217;ve gotten so far, and certainly at WordCamp Europe, is that this is a very welcome evolution. And the Community team has already received over 60 proposals. So I&#8217;m very excited about that. In fact, a WordPress Community Day in Rome has already been announced and is focused on providing meet-up organizing and community management skills. So that&#8217;s pretty cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;[Chloé Bringmann 00:04:37]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wow, that&#8217;s incredible. I love that we&#8217;ve gotten 60 suggestions already and that we already have an event in place. That&#8217;s fantastic. In that blog post, too, it&#8217;s mentioned that WordCamps should prioritize inclusivity and diversity. How can organizers ensure these values are upheld in the next generation of WordCamps and beyond events? Into our day-to-day project involvement?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:05:04]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Excellent question. So while WordCamps themselves are changing, some of our core values, like prioritizing inclusivity and diversity, are non-negotiable. For the whole project, we have a diversity, equity, and inclusion statement, and a Code of Conduct that lays out how we expect our community to engage with each other in this space.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:05:27]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And on top of that, our programs do focus on providing resources and training like how to create a diverse speaker roster. And we have diverse speaker training workshops on how to organize a diverse and inclusive WordPress event. And we also have a great list of third-party resources as well. And so, with so many events, we create a lot of opportunities to grow as a visible contributor, whether it is a speaker, a volunteer, or an organizer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:05:56]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so with the next generation of events, we could more intentionally create these spaces for groups that historically have been underrepresented. Even long before my post went live, the BlackPress meetup group, for example, wanted to create an event that connected with historically black colleges and universities. And an event like that that really invites a specific group to learn all about WordPress would be a really great experience and a wonderful way to celebrate that community and a great connection to the broader community so that we can intentionally get to the diversity that we want to see.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:06:38]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I also want to add that the people who are underrepresented in our community are more likely to need financial sponsorship. And so even though we do keep our ticket prices low so that our events are more easily accessible, the cost of travel continues to increase, not to mention the time and energy required to participate in these events. So an excellent way that companies can help is to sponsor somebody&#8217;s time and somebody&#8217;s contributions, which we&#8217;re always trying to encourage through the Five for the Future program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Chloé Bringmann 00:07:11]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beautiful. So, with that in mind, how do you foresee the next generation of WordCamps impacting the WordPress community, that larger ecosystem? So, what changes do you hope to see regarding community engagement, learning opportunities, and best practices?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:07:31]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I foresee us evolving our tried and true event format into a dynamic wealth of community-led opportunities. I know that online events were pretty exhausting during the worst of the pandemic, but there is a ton of unexplored opportunities there. And community research is also showing that online is a great way to create more inclusive and diverse events.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:07:58]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Training team, with their learn WordPress online workshops, have really led the way with our online events. And there are so many more people that we can reach there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:08:08]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so in addition to providing more advanced content, I also hope to see content around broader tech and business trends that influence WordPress, and conversely, how WordPress can shape those trends as well. And with all of that, I really hope that we can bring in more community members that otherwise wouldn&#8217;t be interested in what we currently offer, especially a younger generation that will help us drive the next generation of WordPress, the open source project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Chloé Bringmann 00:08:39]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Very excited to hear all of this, and I bet our listeners are too. I&#8217;m curious how they and community members can provide feedback or get involved with this next generation of WordCamps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:08:50]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m going to encourage everyone, please come chat with the Community team and comment on the current posts. We really welcome your feedback to help us get our events to this next iteration of what they will become. There are two posts, in particular, one is to suggest ideas of event formats and topics that you would like to see. And the second is if you are an organizer, we&#8217;re inviting you to hear some recommendations for improved tooling that would be helpful for your event site. And we&#8217;ll include links to those posts in the show notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Chloé Bringmann 00:09:26]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One final question for you, Angela. Any thoughts as we prepare for WordCamp US and the Community Summit, which will be in National Harbor, Maryland, in August?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:09:37]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the Community Summit in particular, if you want to attend and you haven&#8217;t already applied, please please do make sure to apply as soon as possible. And encourage somebody else who you think should attend to apply as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:09:53]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if financial constraints are a blocker, we are aiming to help with the cost of hotel and or flight. And so one way to help support the diversity and inclusion of this event, and really to the whole project, is to also contribute to the Community Summit travel fund. You can find information about all of that on the Community Summit site.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:10:15]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And next, if you have a topic in mind that you think needs to be discussed at the Community Summit, please please also share that information with us as well. And last but not least, I am, I am so excited. I&#8217;m not going to spoil anything. But I have been working with the WordCamp US organizing team and looking at some of what they have planned and some of the content. It&#8217;s going to be a truly incredible event, so don&#8217;t miss out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Chloé Bringmann 00:010:41]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, wonderful. Thank you so much for joining me, Angela. And I can&#8217;t wait to see you and the WordPress community in August in person.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Chloé Bringmann 00:010:58]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which brings us now to our small list of big things. First up is the proposal and establishment of a new WordPress contributor team, the Sustainability team. Coming into WordCamp Europe, a proposal was put forward to create a team that would embed sustainable practices and processes in the ecosystem to ensure the Project&#8217;s longevity, both socially, economically, and as well environmentally. At WordCamp Europe, this proposal was confirmed, and the Sustainability team is now officially the 22nd contributor team that WordPressers can support with their contributions. Head on over to their making WordPress Slack channel, #sustainability, and join the conversation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Chloé Bringmann 00:011:39]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, I would like to call your attention to the 6.4 development cycle post that was published on June 5th. 6.4 will be the third major release of 2023 and supports our diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts by being led by those contributors that identify as underrepresented gender. This release will also be the first to kick off phase three of the Gutenberg roadmap, which is collaborative editing and workflows. I&#8217;ve included a link to the post in our show notes and encourage anyone who is interested in being part of this momentous release to join us in making this both impactful and meaningful.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Chloé Bringmann 00:012:16]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, WordCamp US, as discussed, will be upon us before we know it starting on August 24th at National Harbor, Maryland. While tickets may be sold out, volunteers are still very much needed to make the flagship event run smoothly.

More than 2,500 individuals from 94 countries came together in person or through the live stream to participate in a remarkable three-day event (plus Contributor Day) filled with talks, networking, and learning opportunities. The event concluded on June 10 with a captivating keynote address by WordPress co-founder <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/matt/\">Matt Mullenweg</a>, Executive Director <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/chanthaboune/\">Josepha Haden Chomphosy</a>, and Gutenberg Product Architect <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/matveb/\">Matías Ventura</a>, who highlighted the advancements and upcoming milestones of the WordPress Project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One significant update shared during the keynote was the successful reactivation of WordCamps. This time last year, we organized eight in-person WordCamps, and by the end of 2022, the number had risen to 23. Thanks to the enthusiasm and involvement of the WordPress community, we are already on track to organize 25 WordCamps in the first half of this year alone.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha also emphasized the importance of the upcoming Community Summit on August 22-23. This in-person gathering brings contributors together across the WordPress open source project, fostering cross-project discussions vital for future growth and sustainability.

She also underscored the expansion of the WordPress ecosystem, citing examples like <a href=\"https://openverse.org/\">Openverse</a>, which now provides access to nearly 800 million images and audio files, all easily accessible in the Site Editor.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another exciting addition to the WordPress repertoire is <a href=\"https://playground.wordpress.net/\">WP Playground</a>. This new feature allows users to build WordPress applications instantly in the browser without needing a PHP server. This tool provides a swift and seamless experience, reducing the installation time from five minutes to a near-instantaneous 500 milliseconds. The application of WP Playground may seem like magic, but its practical application promises tangible and revolutionary benefits for WordPress users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matías Ventura then took the stage to share updates on Gutenberg. Through a visually stunning video built entirely with blocks, he showcased the six-year development journey and the transition from words to blocks to a final design. The upcoming WordPress version 6.3 will mark the completion of the first two phases of Gutenberg, consolidating all these features into a cohesive and user-friendly experience. He also highlighted the introduction of features such as the Wayfinder tool, Style Book, and the ability to save patterns, further empowering users to own their web presence and voice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following the keynote presentation, the WordPress leadership engaged in a<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzKiKRodHQ0\"> lively Q&amp;A session </a>with the audience, further illustrating the continuous evolution within the WordPress Project. This session highlighted how the WordPress community innovates, iterates, and continually improves to create a better platform for today and tomorrow.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VzKiKRodHQ0?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Join the global community and be part of the WordPress journey toward a brighter future!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Special thanks to <a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/cbringmann/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>cbringmann</a> and <a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/eidolonnight/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>eidolonnight</a> for review and collaboration</em>.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"15167\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"The Month in WordPress – May 2023\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2023/06/the-month-in-wordpress-may-2023/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 06 Jun 2023 10:15:56 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"Month in WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"month in wordpress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=15100\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:350:\"May has been a month of celebrating WordPress and the open source community that makes it possible.

Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>(Intro music)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:40]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the course of this year, there has been a lot of research and examination of the contributor funnel in the WordPress community. That research confirms some assumptions about what most contributor stories have in common: the hurdles, the general paths taken, and the way that problem-solving was done. Then in February of this year, Hari Shanker published a proposal for a mentorship program for WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now we&#8217;ve got a pilot program that&#8217;s been defined and is waiting for your feedback. If you&#8217;ve not read the post about the contributor mentorship program, for one do it. But if you would rather hear a synopsis from me, don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;m about to give you a 10-cent tour.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:22]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First up, who is doing this? This pilot program has been outlined by a community working group. We often have working groups in WordPress, and they almost always have specific projects around events or programs, or code updates. Since this working group is focused on a project-wide program, there is project-wide representation in it. All the names are at the bottom of the post, which you can find in our show notes. But it&#8217;s got folks who contribute with code or contribute with time or contribute with design folks who are self-sponsored or corporately sponsored, just a nice mix of people. The program as a whole, though, is being stewarded by Hari Shankar, a longtime supporter of and contributor to WordPress. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:02:06]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So next, what is this for? There are a few goals for the program. But the overarching goal is to increase the success of new contributors over time. We can all agree that if we were to have 1000s of new contributors every day, but they couldn&#8217;t find their way to impactful contributions or meaningful connections quickly, then we would have done them a disservice. And they probably won&#8217;t continue to be part of the community without a bit more effort.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The when and the where are essentially “right now and right here,” so that brings us finally to Why. Why are we doing this mentorship program? Apart from to help people who want to contribute have an easier path to success – which frankly is enough of a reason anyway – the why is wrapped up in our overall philosophies in the project. If we believe that good ideas can come from anywhere and that contributions of any size matter. And that open source is an idea that can change our generation and that we are democratizing publishing, then bringing new people brings new ideas, and beginner contributions can grow over time. We can maintain this idea, this concept of open source, into the next generation and to future generations. And always keep our sights on the open web. To learn more about this and other project-wide initiatives, swing by make.wordpress.org/project or check the links in today&#8217;s show notes on wordpress.org/news/podcast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:03:53]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which brings us now to our small list of big things.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:03:56]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First on the list is WordCamp Europe. That&#8217;s coming up at the end of the week on June 8 through 10th in Athens, Greece. There will be a major update from Matt and friends, so even if you aren&#8217;t there in person, keep an eye out for those recordings. But for those who are there and you&#8217;re curious about the mentorship program or anything else to do with WordPress and contributing to the project, you can come find me or Angela Jin, Hari will also be there, Chloé will be there, Héctor will be there, lots of people, and we want to hear your thoughts and answer your questions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:27]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second is a call for brainpower! A call for your brainstorms! On the subject of the next generation, we&#8217;ve got a discussion going on about the next generation of WordCamps. We&#8217;ve been discussing what new types and varieties might be available, and that might make sense for people as we get back to in-person events. So if you&#8217;ve got a kind of WordCamp that you&#8217;ve been desperately wanting to try, now&#8217;s the time to let folks know about it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:54]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the final thing is the second volume of The WordPress history book called Building Blocks: The Evolution of WordPress is now available for download in several formats as well as on GitHub.

His initial learning in the 1990s was through joining friends at a local pub where they could explore how websites were structured and learn to use chat software.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This led to Stefano creating websites for fun in 1998, and his first paid job was for the shop where he bought comics. He turned to content management systems (CMS) to speed up the creation process for sites, but found he needed more documentation to really understand their capabilities. Then he read a magazine article about WordPress, a CMS which was being used to make incredible blog sites, and was supported by an international community and documentation. Over time, Stefano started using that documentation to work on websites in Italian.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">WordPress provides a life-changing turning point&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Stefano describes himself as an introvert. He found that WordPress helped him to work from home, to develop his skills and the quality of what he could produce, as well as build his self-confidence.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A catalyst for the turning point in his life and career was the discovery of an area for events on the WordPress dashboard. On this page, he found a forthcoming local meetup in Rome.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In November 2017, Stefano took the step to go along to this event, led by a curiosity of what he might discover and intrigued by how a software could be supported by a vast community. The topic at the event was on <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/cli/\">WP-CLI</a>, a command line interface for WordPress. He recalled that he felt outside his comfort zone as he did not regard himself as a developer and at that point, had only used the software for simple jobs. He wondered whether using the software as his only CMS was going to be a long term option and if these meetups were suitable for him.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the meetup, people were talking about a forthcoming event, called WordCamp Rome. Through his research, he saw that there was a lot of enthusiasm for this event. This intrigued him and he wondered if it would show him that he could have a career using the software after all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfamiliar with WordCamps, Stefano found it difficult at first to know what he could go to and how to get involved, but he persevered and attended the event.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>&#8220;The WordCamp was a great discovery: talks at all levels from basic to those for developers, advanced and very advanced. I was immediately struck by the enthusiasm of the volunteers. It was an environment where I felt very comfortable, so much so, that I asked myself how I could participate in some WordCamps.&#8221;</p>\n<cite>Stefano Cassone</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>From this event, Stefano was encouraged by those he met to consider applying as a volunteer for a future WordCamp.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was also much talk at the event about ‘Slack’. It was new to Stefano, but with help from those attending, he signed up for the messaging tool Slack, used by the WordPress community. He was still unsure how he could contribute, and if he would be welcome.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Joining thousands of volunteer translators of WordPress</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/05/stefano-wc-italia-2022.jpg?resize=800%2C600&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Italian General Translation Editors at WordPress Italia 2022\" class=\"wp-image-15028\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/05/stefano-wc-italia-2022.jpg?w=800&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/05/stefano-wc-italia-2022.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/05/stefano-wc-italia-2022.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Italian General Translation Editors at WordPress Italia 2022</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Stefano took the plunge and was excited to find there was a team called Polyglots. In this team, people from across the world<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/\"> translate the WordPress software into many different languages</a>. He started with translating a theme he was using in his work. Little by little he became more interested in plugins and attended meetings with other translators. He offered his skills to translate into Italian themes and plugins in general and as his experience grew, he took on the volunteer role of a General Translation Editor. He also took care of the translation into Italian of the WordPress Core. More recently he has joined the group of translators for the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/docs/handbook/helphub/\">HelpHub</a>, which is part of the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/docs/\">WordPress documentation</a> system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said: “Participating in the WordPress Slack has helped me enormously: I’ve met a lot of people who I now call friends. Moreover, by translating, I learned a lot about how themes and plugins work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It&#8217;s a great way to contribute to WordPress, especially for someone like me who is not a developer. Translating also allows me to fully understand how WordPress works.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>&#8220;I always say that translating themes, plugins, and the Core software is the best way to learn WordPress, better than any course or book.”</p>\n<cite>Stefano Cassone</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sharing skills to support Open Source WordPress</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"667\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/05/stefano-at-WC-2019.jpg?resize=667%2C500&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Stefano volunteering as a photographer at a WordCamp in 2019 with other contributors.\" class=\"wp-image-15026\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/05/stefano-at-WC-2019.jpg?w=667&amp;ssl=1 667w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/05/stefano-at-WC-2019.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 667px) 100vw, 667px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Stefano volunteering as a photographer at a WordCamp in 2019 with other contributors.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Stefano’s growing commitment to the open source WordPress project was further boosted through his volunteering. He was a volunteer at WordCamp Rome 2018 and participated there in his first Contributor Day where he had the opportunity to translate the software with others.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He was also able to bring his own hobbies and skills to help the project grow and reach others. One example was his passion for photography, and he volunteered as a photographer for many other events in Italy organized by the WordPress community. He said: “This commitment to the community also allows me to have fun: being a photographer means having the opportunity to walk around the halls and capture moments of the life of a WordCamp.” The more WordCamps he attended, the more he wanted to be part of and keep contributing to the wider WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Contribution to WordPress is inspiring</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/05/stefano-at-the-support-table-contributor-day.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Stefano at the Support Table at a WordPress Contributor Day\" class=\"wp-image-15025\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/05/stefano-at-the-support-table-contributor-day.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/05/stefano-at-the-support-table-contributor-day.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/05/stefano-at-the-support-table-contributor-day.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/05/stefano-at-the-support-table-contributor-day.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Stefano at the Support Table at a WordPress Contributor Day</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>When Stefano was asked to become an organizer for the WordPress meetup in Rome in October 2019, he knew he wanted to be part of reaching and supporting more people in his area. He faced challenges with finding venues, but a greater issue was to come: the Covid-19 pandemic.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Spurred on by the <a href=\"https://it.wordpress.org/\">Italian WordPress community</a> as a whole, he was determined that the meetup was still needed. The regular event was transformed into an online meeting. He was able to gain help from people he had met as a volunteer to share their expertise with meetup attendees.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The community in Italy also worked together to put on WordCamp Italia online. It brought together the organizers of previous meetups and WordCamps, and new contributors too. Stefano volunteered in both online editions of this camp, including being part of the social and communication team. He found it to not only be a fun experience but also one that helped him grow professionally and learn from so many others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He went onto help restart the <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/romawordpress/\">Rome WordPress meetup</a> in-person meetings in May 2022, was an organizer for the third WordCamp Italy, and has been volunteering for camps in 2023.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What will WordPress bring you?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"533\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/05/stefano-at-a-wc.jpg?resize=533%2C800&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Stefano inspired by his journey at WordCamps asks what will WordPress bring you?\" class=\"wp-image-15024\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/05/stefano-at-a-wc.jpg?w=533&amp;ssl=1 533w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/05/stefano-at-a-wc.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 533px) 100vw, 533px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Stefano inspired by his journey at WordCamps asks what will WordPress bring you?</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>“Persona and professional growth and friendship” are some of the things they have brought Stefano. Contributing boosted his confidence and willingness to try new opportunities in his work.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said: “The best thing I got out of joining the WordPress community was the chance to collaborate with some people on a working basis and, I have to say, that was incredible. Being with many of them you have an incredible opportunity to grow in knowledge, you just have to be ready to learn. With WordPress you never stop learning.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His top recommendation is: “Join your local meetup or think about organizing one, it will introduce you to an amazing world. Don’t be afraid to meet people at WordCamps and Contributor Days, because you will learn more there than in dozens of courses. Talk to people at those events and don’t worry. The WordPress community is inclusive so you’ll always feel welcome, and you will see enthusiasm like you’ve never seen at other IT events. Sign-up and get involved.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Share the stories</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Help share these stories of open source contributors and continue to grow the community.&nbsp;Meet more WordPressers in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/category/newsletter/interviews/\">People of WordPress series</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Contributors</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to Stefano Cassone (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/deadpool76/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>deadpool76</a>)&nbsp;for sharing about his adventures in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you to Abha Thakor (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/webcommsat/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>webcommsat</a>), the late Surendra Thakor (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/sthakor/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>sthakor</a>) and Meher Bala (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/meher/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>meher</a>) for interviews, writing the feature and collaborating on images, to Chloe Bringmann (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/cbringmann/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>cbringmann</a>), Mark Smallman (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/marks99/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>marks99</a>), Nalini Thakor (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/nalininonstopnewsuk/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>nalininonstopnewsuk</a>), Mary Baum (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/marybaum/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>marybaum</a>), and Maja Loncar (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/majaloncar/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>majaloncar</a>) for help with reviews.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The&nbsp;<em>People of WordPress</em>&nbsp;series thanks Josepha Haden (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/chanthaboune/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>chanthaboune</a>) and Topher DeRosia (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/topher1kenobe/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>topher1kenobe</a>) for their support.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile is-vertically-aligned-center\" style=\"grid-template-columns:29% auto\"><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"180\" height=\"135\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/03/heropress_logo_180.png?resize=180%2C135&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"HeroPress logo\" class=\"wp-image-8409 size-full\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\"><em>This People of WordPress feature is inspired by an essay originally published on </em><a href=\"https://heropress.com/\"><em>HeroPress.com</em></a><em>, a community initiative created by Topher DeRosia.

Phase four of the Gutenberg project is native multilingual support, and so I see this work that is being done as instrumental, not only for our global community but in support of what&#8217;s to come in that specific roadmap.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:00:59]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So without further ado, Alex Kirk, welcome to the WordPress Briefing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:01:03]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hello, how are you doing?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:01:05]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m good. I&#8217;m good. Can you, let&#8217;s, because I bet that not a lot of people know who you are, can you first start by just telling me a bit about your work with WordPress, and then let us know what GlotPress is, for those of us who don&#8217;t know yet?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:01:19]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. So, Automattic sponsors me to work in the WordPress project on the Meta team and on the Polyglots team. So I spent time on improving or helping improve the software that powers the translation on WordPress.org. But I also work on the meta team on things like Matrix and evaluating if it would be a good fit for WordPress to switch to Matrix for their chat system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:01:46]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So a lot of really big projects that you work on, all of that kind of stuff that has no easy solutions anymore, is where you are right now. Huh?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:01:56]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, there&#8217;s no clear path, but it&#8217;s our mission to find it. So that&#8217;s part of what makes things interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:02:05]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cool. So for folks who don&#8217;t know too much about the Polyglots team or generally translating WordPress, the software, can you let us know a bit about what GlotPress is?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:02:16]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right. So the translation system that powers WordPress.org is called GlotPress. It used to be a standalone software that was developed a couple of years ago, and it was transformed into a WordPress plugin at some point, and now powers the translation that happens on WordPress.org. So we translate WordPress core there from English to other languages, plugins, themes, block patterns, and it all happens through this software called GlotPress. There are a couple GlotPress installations around the world, but I think the WordPress.org one is one of the bigger ones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:02:55]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Probably, WordPress.org is pretty, pretty massive. Also, I think it&#8217;s great that you said that GlotPress was created a couple of years ago, like that, that indicates to me that you&#8217;re working on a really different timescale than a lot of folks are in WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:03:10]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So Alex, tell me a little bit about what it takes to ship translated WordPress software. So, I mean, for people who don&#8217;t need translated WordPress, like obviously we don&#8217;t have a good idea of what it takes to make sure that WordPress is available in so many languages. So what goes into the work of making sure that that happens?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:03:32]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right, so typically the WordPress software and plugins and themes are primarily created in English. And for it to be available in other languages, it needs to be translated. And for that to be able to happen, the programmers need to make the software translatable. Basically, they&#8217;re providing each English string for the translation software to be available to be transformed, so to speak, into another language and to what it&#8217;s being transformed to. This is what the translators do. So they go into the GlotPress software and see the list of texts that need to be translated and translate it to their language that they speak. Typically there is a process around this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:03:32]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, we&#8217;ve got people who have lots of experience in translation. And specifically in translating WordPress or WordPress plugins. And they&#8217;re kind of the, the people who help ensure good quality of translation. So anybody who&#8217;s working the WordPress project, so basically who has a WordPress.org account, can come in and address the translation. And that translation enters the system, so to speak, in a waiting state. And then somebody who we promoted to be a Translation Editor will come along and take a look at your translation and will approve it or will give you suggestions how to do the translation in a better way, or come up with maybe even a better translation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:05:03]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, when you have like a small thing that&#8217;s just not right, like a missing full stop or something like that. They might just add it for you. And well, as soon as the plugin or software is translated to a certain level of translations those translations will be shipped out to the WordPress installs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:05:20]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, for example, for a plugin, you would reach 90% of translated strings. Those translations will then be basically packed up into zip file, a language pack and delivered to each WordPress so that you can have the translations available there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:05:35]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And is 90% the threshold for plugins only, or is that also the threshold for like themes and the CMS itself?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:05:34]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well. We strive for 100%, I would say.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:05:47]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Good. <em>( laughs )</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:05:48]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, 90% more of a motivational point. To be actually honest, I&#8217;m not sure if the threshold is 90% for every project or even if it&#8217;s actually 90%. It&#8217;s different between different GlotPress installations and it&#8217;s basically something that is made as a setting that can be changed. There&#8217;s, it&#8217;s an arbitrary number. Typically you&#8217;d actually want to make sure that the most important strings are translated first. So the ones like, if you look at the whole picture, software usually consists of many parts, many of whom are not encountered by people on a regular basis. For example, error messages that could be like obscure error messages, and you could argue that those might be not as important. Or even sometimes you could even say like, do they need to be translated? Because if you encounter an error message and you search the internet, wouldn&#8217;t you probably want everybody to search for the English one to find the solution? But that set-aside, it&#8217;s important to have like the headline of the plugin or like the most important strings translated, and typically translating those most important strings will take you to a pretty high percentage so that we can then say it&#8217;s good enough to be shipped.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:07:02]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gotcha. I see, I see. Okay. Well, we talked a bit earlier about GlotPress&#8217;s timeline. It has been around for a bit, I know. But with that kind of in mind, have there been any notable changes to GlotPress recently?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:07:19]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, so I think for GlotPress there&#8217;s been a bit of an up and down over time in terms of engagement and progress on the software. But in, in the recent year, I think we&#8217;ve added a couple of things that have been very helpful for translators. So one of them was adding the commenting functionality, so yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:07:35]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Super helpful. Shocked it wasn&#8217;t there before. Sorry, translators. Sorry, all of our polyglots.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:07:40]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, it can be like there was when GlotPress was created there, there is like the, a big part of GlotPress are these states, like the waiting state when you enter translation, and then there&#8217;s approved state, which basically a translation we say it&#8217;s set to current, and there&#8217;s all sorts of process around it. So if the software is updated or translation might get fuzzy. But also like, if somebody submits a translation that doesn&#8217;t fully conform to what&#8217;s the translation editors, or like what the standards of the translation community have been set to, then you would have to need to reject it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:08:16]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that has been something that we felt wasn&#8217;t a very good and enticing way of telling people like, we appreciate your work. It wasn&#8217;t just quite right, but it&#8217;s more of a rejection. So this is how we came up with this like, let&#8217;s give people the option to say what was wrong and give them a chance to try again without making them feel rejected.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:08:38]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Sort of a &#8220;No, but&#8230;&#8221; as opposed to a, just refusal to receive it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:08:45]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And other things that we&#8217;ve worked on is, like, with the recent search of AI, like getting help from AI on translation and also on reviews. So, there&#8217;s some interesting things that you can do with AI in that regard; that one important aspect of translations, it&#8217;s also that we&#8217;ve got glossaries for each language where people, basically the translation community, identifies certain words they want to translate them the same way every time.&nbsp;And with the AI, you can basically add to the prompt, like, please translate those words to those translations when you give me a translation for that. And as it can change over time, you can always adapt this to the prompt, and that has been proven quite helpful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:09:25]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is great. That&#8217;s one of those things I know that AI has been like a really popular thing to talk about. And AI, specifically for translations, I think has caused some concern that maybe we&#8217;ll just like translate it all and hope that computers get it right when we know pretty certainly that computers don&#8217;t always get the translations right. But that&#8217;s not what you&#8217;re talking about, right? What you&#8217;re suggesting is that AI would suggest what could be translated and what it could be translated to, and then human beings have to confirm that that&#8217;s correct, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:09:59]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s exactly it. So basically, we give suggestions to the translators, and then they can modify a translation before they press save. It&#8217;s more of a, like supporting them in getting the translations, like looking up words more quickly and all of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:10:16]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s wonderful. So is that the major sort of next step that is coming for GlotPress, or are there other things that we should keep an eye out for in that software?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:10:27]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So one direction that we&#8217;ve been taking GlotPress is basically making use of the fact that GlotPress is WordPress plugin now. And you know, typically, you would just use a GlotPress install. So on WordPress.Org, there&#8217;s like GlotPress installed, there&#8217;s translation projects created, something that we call &#8220;translation sets&#8221;. So for languages, you want to translate it to, it&#8217;s all pre-configured, and if you would install GlotPress to plugin on your own WordPress, it would be empty and not very useful. So what we&#8217;ve added is a way for you to basically be able to translate the plugins and themes that you&#8217;ve got installed in your WordPress into the language that you&#8217;re interested in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:11:07]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you might have a non-English website that you want to use certain plugins with, and they might not be fully translated at this point, so obviously, you could go to WordPress.org and help translate them, and that&#8217;s the way to, that&#8217;s preferred. But you could also now go install GlotPress on your own website and translate there. And then you have the translations there right when you enter them. And you can then contribute those translations back to WordPress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:11:35]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s with local GlotPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:11:37]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s something that we call local GlotPress. And you know, since we then have all these translations in the local database, it means we can do even more with those translations. So typically, language packs would be delivered to WordPress, but with local GlotPress, you&#8217;ve got like all the GlotPress software there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:11:56]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we can do things like inline translation. So, on your own WordPress and wp-admin, for example, we can highlight all the strings that can be translated, and those strings just have to right-click them and enter your translation, and that way, you can basically go about and translate the whole ui, seeing your progress, as you&#8217;re making, basically turning the screen from red to green.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:12:20]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Yeah. So that&#8217;s something now that you can do in your local WordPress installation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:12:26]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Basically, it&#8217;s completely independent of WordPress.org. We would ask you to contribute the translations back when you have them, but being independent also allows you to translate like premium plugins, which could not be hosted on WordPress.org or doing something like that we call like hyper-local translation. So, for example, I speak Austrian German natively, but even inside Austria, we&#8217;ve got different dialects or like special words that we use. And if I wanted to create a website that&#8217;s targeted at the Viennese market, for example, I might want to use those specific terms. And this is something I would have to argue for those translations to be accepted on WordPress.org because it&#8217;s a, it&#8217;s like a very targeted market. But if I have a local GlotPress, I can do those translations there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:13:11]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That seems awfully beneficial, especially as dialects. I&#8217;ve been having these conversations. I have, in my extended family, many children, and they are all learning languages and one of them has been having kind of thoughts about, like, dialects and how dialects are almost another language. And if so, like how do you know what everybody&#8217;s saying when you&#8217;re speaking all the same thing, but it&#8217;s kind of a little bit it sounds a little bit different.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:13:37]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s certainly a thing in the US, the distinct dialects across our country. And so I imagine that that&#8217;s gonna be a really beneficial sort of implementation for countries that have a lot of different regional variations and certainly smaller countries that have technically the same language as somebody else, but a lot of regional differences, regional specific things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:14:01]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is that the same or different as the live translations, Translate Live, that we talked about at the WordCamp Europe a couple weeks back?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:14:12]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right. So, Translate Live is kind of the next step after local GlotPress. It&#8217;s like this happy marriage between the WordPress Playground and local GlotPress. So the WordPress Playground is also something that has come up a lot. It&#8217;s basically a way for you to run WordPress inside a browser window, so in JavaScript. And at first, it seems like mildly interesting, I would say. But when you combine it with other things like local GlotPress, it can lead to really interesting opportunities. So with inline translation, for example, on WordPress.org, you would typically find for every plugin, the UI would look the same. You would have a table of strings, and all that makes you realize you&#8217;re translating this certain plugin is that in the header of the page, it says this name of the plugin, but other than that, it can look really all the same.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:15:07]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now, with WordPress Playground, you can put up a WordPress and run this plugin inside that Playground. And now, if you add local GlotPress to the picture, you can also do the inline translation of that plugin inside the WordPress Playground. So you&#8217;ve got inline translation. We add the glossary so they do make sure that you translate things the same way that they&#8217;re expected, and you don&#8217;t have to install the plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:15:33]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And still, you can see what the translations will look like. You can see the strings next to each other, and what I think is most important, you will start with the strings that you see first, which are the most important ones. When you&#8217;re in the table view, those strings might be somewhere buried in the middle, and yeah, it&#8217;s really hard to see progress if you start with kind of obscure error messages, for example, versus just starting with the things that you see first.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:16:02]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. So, moving translations away from table-based translations where you kind of have to know what you&#8217;re looking for. So the Translate Live, along with local GlotPress, along with WP Playground, is going to make it so that it&#8217;s easier to see visually what needs to be translated, where, what&#8217;s most valuable to translate for your mid users and your end users, basically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:16:30]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That, and also like for plug-in authors, it can be really good to see, you know, you can switch the languages in the Playground to another language, and you can quickly see like what&#8217;s the state of the translation in this language or in that language. And even things like, you know, Arabic as an RTL language rights to left language. The sidebar will change to the right, and you can also just switch language and see like, what&#8217;s my plugin like in this environment. I mean, this is not technically something that&#8217;s related to local GlotPress, but in this translation live ui, it&#8217;s very easy to change languages and see your plugin in another language.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:17:06]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, it&#8217;s not specifically related to, to Translations Live, but also, I think that if we&#8217;re saying that WordPress not necessarily is going to lead the way with translations and native multilingual support in our CMS because, of course, it&#8217;s still a little bit far out on our roadmap. We certainly have an opportunity to have the best implementation of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:17:27]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And even if like that specific use case that you&#8217;re talking about isn&#8217;t related directly to what it is that you are working on for Polyglots and inside GlotPress and all of that, I do see that having more streamlined, more easy to see and access opportunities to like test the way that our software looks across varying environments, especially those that change it substantially from what we typically work in day-to-day for any individual developer or any individual WordPress site implementer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:18:00</strong>]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, I think that that is a big step forward for all of us and certainly for anyone who is having to use WordPress as not a native English speaker. And so you say it&#8217;s not related, but it still is a big, a big benefit for WordPress overall, I think, to have this kind of work happening so that we can have those benefits to the folks who are using our software.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:18:22]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there were a couple of different things that you mentioned over the course of our conversation. We&#8217;re gonna put some links to the show notes for all of those. But one thing that you mentioned that just kind of went by, and we never really had an opportunity to talk about it. You talked about the, I think it was GTEs, Global Translation Editors, the folks that are like approved as final approvers of translations. If there is someone who&#8217;s listening to this podcast who wants to become a GTE someday, where would they go to do that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:18:54]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the path to GTE is a PTE.&nbsp;<em>( laughs )</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:18:59]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, we&#8217;ve got different levels of translation editors. Basically, you start, you could say you start off as a translator, and this is how you can kind of show that you can do good translations or that you&#8217;re very firm in your language. And this might make you be noticed in the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:19:16]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we&#8217;re always looking for people who like to help with translations. And you might be then promoted to be a Project Translation Editor. Basically, it means that for a single language in a project, you&#8217;ll be able to approve translations. So, you&#8217;ll be the one who says, like, this translation is a good one and this conforms to the to the rules that we have stated as a translation community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:19:42]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And further down the path then is the GTE, where you basically are allowed to approve translations across any project on translate.WordPress.org in your language. And that&#8217;s, usually you&#8217;ll be in, in that position with other GTEs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:20:04]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there is, like, in each community, there is like, we&#8217;re people based. We talk about what might be a good translation. We talk to each other, try to find rules that maybe prevent common mistranslations, or set the standards for how we want the software to be translated. And this is something where you get a voice as a translator, but as a GTE, you get into a position where you can actually make the changes or find consensus on how the software should be translated in your language.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:20:35]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if folks are not familiar where the Polyglots team works and meets, where would they find you all?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:20:41]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>At make.WordPress.org/polyglots.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:20:45]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perfect. Alex, this has been such a fascinating conversation. Thank you so much for joining me today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:20:50]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you very much.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>( Intermission music )</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:20:59]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that brings us now to our small list of big things. First, WP Campus 2023 is taking place July 12th through the 14th. That&#8217;s a nonprofit three-day conference with topics that focus on the growth of higher education, accessibility, WordPress, and anyone who works in higher education.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:21:17]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a hybrid event. There is an in-person component on the beautiful campus of Tulane University in New Orleans, Louisiana.

And so stop by and add your thoughts there in the comments.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:22:38]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is your small list of big things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:22:42]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing.

Her parents gave her own WordPress website to use, play, test, and try whatever she wanted with it. Her health issues had started when she was eight years old, and being able to express who she was and learn new skills provided an escape she needed. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">My first encounter with WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Allison said: &#8220;While the technical aspects of my new WordPress website intrigued me, I was more interested in the space it made for me to write. All throughout my childhood I had struggled with chronic pain, fatigue, and other unexplained symptoms. Having a private world I could call my own, I was able to write my story.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>&#8220;There is something truly amazing about having a place to tell your story.&#8221;</p>\n<cite>Allison Dye</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Her family faced many doctors, nurse, specialists and hospital visits, but could not get an answer to the difficulties faced by Allison. She said: &#8220;I felt like my life and world were out of control. But logging onto my little website and typing away on the computer keys gave me a sense of control. I couldn’t always do things that other kids had the energy to do. But I could get lost in writing for hours. I couldn’t control my life story, but I could write about it.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She felt it was like writing letters to her future self and would act as a reminder of how strong she had become. Even now when Allison writes on her website, she feels it is writing letters to her past self, expressing reassurance and pride. The practice of writing online continues to help her reflect on how she coped and made it through the difficulties.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">WordPress in the real world</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Allison hoped her early experiences with hospitals and being unwell was just part of being a child, and that in adulthood she would be healthy. She longed for this time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Growing up did not bring her this dream of a healthier life and an end to chronic pain. In fact, her condition worsened as she went through her teens and at 18 she finally received a diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/06/allison-2.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Allison stood in front of trees\" class=\"wp-image-15290\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/06/allison-2.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/06/allison-2.jpg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/06/allison-2.jpg?w=900&amp;ssl=1 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Allison enjoying time with nature and trees</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This changed what had been conventional job choices, as she was not able to handle a 9 to 5 work schedule. She could not drive herself to work on some days and relied on her mother to help with transport. She knew that she would have to find another way to work and she was determined to find it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She began writing music and book reviews online, and then moved onto writing blog posts. As they were published she started to receive payment and a sense of power over her life. She said: &#8220;WordPress felt familiar, typing on the computer keys felt comfortable, and sharing my words with the world felt surreal.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Allison&#8217;s sense of ownership of the software became part of her strength. &#8220;I think I believed WordPress was mine somehow. I was learning that WordPress is something that belongs to everyone in some way. And I loved it.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Finding work with WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The confidence using the platform gave Allison led her to find more about what it could do and meet other people who used it. She said: &#8220;The thing I love about WordPress is that it’s not just for developers or bloggers or SEO experts. I began to meet more people in the community and was delighted to find people like me, who didn’t know the technical stuff, but were a part of WordPress.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This global community orbiting around the software gave her an opportunity to meet social media managers, designers, and people from many different areas. She found that &#8216;there was a place for everyone&#8217;. The guiding strength and fascination Allison found and still finds today is in that community. Allison said: &#8220;The community felt as important as the rest of everything that makes WordPress what it is. It felt like it was about people and relationships as well as codes and databases.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2020, she was hired by a WordPress company. She said: &#8220;I like being a part of a WordPress company, and I love that I contribute to a team that helps people with their websites. I understand the importance of having a space that’s yours. Whether it’s a business or personal site, having a website gives you the power of telling your own story.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress gave Allison a freedom and an independence. She did not have to work a 9 to 5 job, rely on others to drive her on bad days with her MS, nor worry about days when she wanted to stay in her sweatshirts rather than go into an office to work. She said: &#8220;I have a 100% remote job which I can do despite the plot twists in my story, thanks to WordPress and the people in it.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress took Allison into the world of project management for a small agency, and this experience was to help guide her path, skills and confidence into the future. She went on to work in content management in WordPress, building pages for awareness campaigns for non profit organizations and small businesses as a contractor. She helps people update their websites, add and edit content, perform basic updates and help them to learn how to use their sites. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>&#8220;I tell all my clients to use WordPress because there is really no other solution that can scale as easily for growing organizations and small businesses. I love how WordPress allows them to tell their stories, share their passion, and have a place to call their own on the internet.&#8221;</p>\n<cite>Allison Dye</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>As a fluent English and Italian speaker, Allison is able to support clients in different countries from where she lives. &#8220;I love that with WordPress I&#8217;m able to support clients remotely. This is thanks to all of the many WordPress contributors, developers, project managers, content writers, and many, many volunteers that work tirelessly to enable people around the world to use WordPress.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Allison also became a certified as an English As A Second Language (ESL) teacher. &#8220;My affinity for words and languages allows me to teach passionately and creatively. I’m Italian-American and am fluent in English and Italian. Teaching English allows me to share my passion for communication with others.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Welcomed into the WordPress community</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"562\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/06/WPCoffeeTalk-Allie-Dye.png?resize=1024%2C562&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Allie interviewed for a podcast on her use of WordPress\" class=\"wp-image-15293\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/06/WPCoffeeTalk-Allie-Dye.png?resize=1024%2C562&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/06/WPCoffeeTalk-Allie-Dye.png?resize=300%2C165&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/06/WPCoffeeTalk-Allie-Dye.png?resize=768%2C422&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/06/WPCoffeeTalk-Allie-Dye.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Allie interviewed for a podcast on her use of WordPress</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Allison attributes mentors and supporters in the WordPress community for helping her appreciate she really is part of it. Allison recalled: &#8220;It felt unreal. I wasn’t a dev, I don’t know how to code, and yet I got to be a part of it all? I felt like I was a fake. But Kimberly continues to remind me that I’m real, I get to be here, I get to stay, I have a place.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She was later encouraged to contribute by a WordPress community member to the Big Orange Heart, which aims to support and promote positive well-being and mental health within remote working communities. She said she felt &#8216;honored typing my words, pieces of my story, and sharing them with a community of people&#8217;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She also joined the <a href=\"https://us.wordcamp.org/2021/\">WordCamp US 2021</a> online organizing team. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Allison enjoys the fact that in the WordPress community, &#8216;everyone here is constantly working to be better and do better&#8217;.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Facing the future with strength from her friends and colleagues in WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"675\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/06/allison-1.jpg?resize=675%2C900&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-15289\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/06/allison-1.jpg?w=675&amp;ssl=1 675w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/06/allison-1.jpg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 675px) 100vw, 675px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Allison was later diagnosed with two additional neurological conditions: Functional Neurological Disorder and Migraine. She said: &#8220;If it were not for WordPress I would really be unable to work. But WordPress and its community continue to be a part of my life and I am grateful to everyone who&#8217;s helped me along my way. I don&#8217;t know where I would even be without it.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She strives to raise awareness of dynamic disabilities and invisible illnesses like her own through podcasts and social media.

00:00:10]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hello, everyone, and welcome to the WordPress Briefing, the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project, some insight into the community that supports it, and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your guest host Chloé Bringmann. And here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>(Intro music)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Chloé Bringmann 00:00:40]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I have the privilege of guest hosting this episode of the WordPress Briefing. And today I have with me a very special guest. The Head of Programs and Contributor Experience, Angela Jin. Welcome. Before we dive into all the questions, can you tell me and our listeners a little bit about your role in the WordPress community?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:01:01]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, happy to, and thank you so much for having me. I&#8217;m very excited to be here. I am the Head of Programs and Contributor Experience, and I provide oversight and guidance for our WordPress programs, such as our events programs, training, and Five for the Future, with an eye toward ensuring their sustainability and growth. I&#8217;m very fortunate to work with our contributors across many teams around the world. In addition to troubleshooting and helping folks figure out how to move forward, I also spend a good amount of time exploring with others what could be in our programs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Chloé Bringmann 00:01:41]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We just got back from WordCamp Europe in Athens, Greece. It was such an energizing event for me, but I&#8217;m curious about what your impressions were of the past week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:01:52]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, it was fantastic. I&#8217;m always really inspired by what a group of like-minded people can achieve together. There&#8217;s a lot of passion for this particular WordCamp, and it made for a really wonderful WordPress experience. Full of lots of great connections and memories; I have a million follow-ups and probably even more thoughts to reflect on. So it&#8217;s great. There were a lot of new WordPressers there. So it was lovely to meet them. And I&#8217;m really excited to see how many exciting new projects and ideas that we have in the space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Chloé Bringmann 00:02:27]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Same, you said it perfectly. Josepha also mentioned in the flagship’s keynote, the proposal for the next generation of WordCamps. I&#8217;m curious about what the main ideas and goals, as discussed thus far, are of that proposal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:02:42]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For sure. So WordCamps have been fundamental for the WordPress community for a very long time. And while they have continued to grow larger and reach more places around the world, it&#8217;s also undeniable that the way that people meet has changed since 2006.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:03:01]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, just as WordPress itself iterates we&#8217;re looking at iterating on WordCamps so that they move from fundamental to indispensable for the WordPressers of today and tomorrow. So event attendees today are looking to learn essential skills, make connections that lead to neat opportunities, and more.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:03:23]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So to that end, we put forth an updated purpose for our events, which is that WordPress events spark innovation and adoption by way of accessible training and networking for users, builders, designers, and extenders. We celebrate community by accelerating 21st-century skills, professional opportunities, and partnerships for WordPressers of today and tomorrow.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:03:47]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the goal here is to create events that are more clearly defined &#8211; who these are for what you will gain from attending. We are looking to see events that take a deeper dive into content, or topics and provide more advanced content. And let&#8217;s try out some different formats and see how that shapes our event experience. And so it is a big shift. And change is always hard.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:04:13]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the feedback that I&#8217;ve gotten so far, and certainly at WordCamp Europe, is that this is a very welcome evolution. And the Community team has already received over 60 proposals. So I&#8217;m very excited about that. In fact, a WordPress Community Day in Rome has already been announced and is focused on providing meet-up organizing and community management skills. So that&#8217;s pretty cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;[Chloé Bringmann 00:04:37]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wow, that&#8217;s incredible. I love that we&#8217;ve gotten 60 suggestions already and that we already have an event in place. That&#8217;s fantastic. In that blog post, too, it&#8217;s mentioned that WordCamps should prioritize inclusivity and diversity. How can organizers ensure these values are upheld in the next generation of WordCamps and beyond events? Into our day-to-day project involvement?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:05:04]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Excellent question. So while WordCamps themselves are changing, some of our core values, like prioritizing inclusivity and diversity, are non-negotiable. For the whole project, we have a diversity, equity, and inclusion statement, and a Code of Conduct that lays out how we expect our community to engage with each other in this space.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:05:27]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And on top of that, our programs do focus on providing resources and training like how to create a diverse speaker roster. And we have diverse speaker training workshops on how to organize a diverse and inclusive WordPress event. And we also have a great list of third-party resources as well. And so, with so many events, we create a lot of opportunities to grow as a visible contributor, whether it is a speaker, a volunteer, or an organizer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:05:56]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so with the next generation of events, we could more intentionally create these spaces for groups that historically have been underrepresented. Even long before my post went live, the BlackPress meetup group, for example, wanted to create an event that connected with historically black colleges and universities. And an event like that that really invites a specific group to learn all about WordPress would be a really great experience and a wonderful way to celebrate that community and a great connection to the broader community so that we can intentionally get to the diversity that we want to see.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:06:38]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I also want to add that the people who are underrepresented in our community are more likely to need financial sponsorship. And so even though we do keep our ticket prices low so that our events are more easily accessible, the cost of travel continues to increase, not to mention the time and energy required to participate in these events. So an excellent way that companies can help is to sponsor somebody&#8217;s time and somebody&#8217;s contributions, which we&#8217;re always trying to encourage through the Five for the Future program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Chloé Bringmann 00:07:11]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beautiful. So, with that in mind, how do you foresee the next generation of WordCamps impacting the WordPress community, that larger ecosystem? So, what changes do you hope to see regarding community engagement, learning opportunities, and best practices?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:07:31]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I foresee us evolving our tried and true event format into a dynamic wealth of community-led opportunities. I know that online events were pretty exhausting during the worst of the pandemic, but there is a ton of unexplored opportunities there. And community research is also showing that online is a great way to create more inclusive and diverse events.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:07:58]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Training team, with their learn WordPress online workshops, have really led the way with our online events. And there are so many more people that we can reach there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:08:08]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so in addition to providing more advanced content, I also hope to see content around broader tech and business trends that influence WordPress, and conversely, how WordPress can shape those trends as well. And with all of that, I really hope that we can bring in more community members that otherwise wouldn&#8217;t be interested in what we currently offer, especially a younger generation that will help us drive the next generation of WordPress, the open source project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Chloé Bringmann 00:08:39]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Very excited to hear all of this, and I bet our listeners are too. I&#8217;m curious how they and community members can provide feedback or get involved with this next generation of WordCamps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:08:50]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m going to encourage everyone, please come chat with the Community team and comment on the current posts. We really welcome your feedback to help us get our events to this next iteration of what they will become. There are two posts, in particular, one is to suggest ideas of event formats and topics that you would like to see. And the second is if you are an organizer, we&#8217;re inviting you to hear some recommendations for improved tooling that would be helpful for your event site. And we&#8217;ll include links to those posts in the show notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Chloé Bringmann 00:09:26]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One final question for you, Angela. Any thoughts as we prepare for WordCamp US and the Community Summit, which will be in National Harbor, Maryland, in August?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:09:37]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the Community Summit in particular, if you want to attend and you haven&#8217;t already applied, please please do make sure to apply as soon as possible. And encourage somebody else who you think should attend to apply as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:09:53]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if financial constraints are a blocker, we are aiming to help with the cost of hotel and or flight. And so one way to help support the diversity and inclusion of this event, and really to the whole project, is to also contribute to the Community Summit travel fund. You can find information about all of that on the Community Summit site.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:10:15]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And next, if you have a topic in mind that you think needs to be discussed at the Community Summit, please please also share that information with us as well. And last but not least, I am, I am so excited. I&#8217;m not going to spoil anything. But I have been working with the WordCamp US organizing team and looking at some of what they have planned and some of the content. It&#8217;s going to be a truly incredible event, so don&#8217;t miss out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Chloé Bringmann 00:010:41]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, wonderful. Thank you so much for joining me, Angela. And I can&#8217;t wait to see you and the WordPress community in August in person.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Chloé Bringmann 00:010:58]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which brings us now to our small list of big things. First up is the proposal and establishment of a new WordPress contributor team, the Sustainability team. Coming into WordCamp Europe, a proposal was put forward to create a team that would embed sustainable practices and processes in the ecosystem to ensure the Project&#8217;s longevity, both socially, economically, and as well environmentally. At WordCamp Europe, this proposal was confirmed, and the Sustainability team is now officially the 22nd contributor team that WordPressers can support with their contributions. Head on over to their making WordPress Slack channel, #sustainability, and join the conversation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Chloé Bringmann 00:011:39]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, I would like to call your attention to the 6.4 development cycle post that was published on June 5th. 6.4 will be the third major release of 2023 and supports our diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts by being led by those contributors that identify as underrepresented gender. This release will also be the first to kick off phase three of the Gutenberg roadmap, which is collaborative editing and workflows. I&#8217;ve included a link to the post in our show notes and encourage anyone who is interested in being part of this momentous release to join us in making this both impactful and meaningful.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Chloé Bringmann 00:012:16]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, WordCamp US, as discussed, will be upon us before we know it starting on August 24th at National Harbor, Maryland. While tickets may be sold out, volunteers are still very much needed to make the flagship event run smoothly.

More than 2,500 individuals from 94 countries came together in person or through the live stream to participate in a remarkable three-day event (plus Contributor Day) filled with talks, networking, and learning opportunities. The event concluded on June 10 with a captivating keynote address by WordPress co-founder <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/matt/\">Matt Mullenweg</a>, Executive Director <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/chanthaboune/\">Josepha Haden Chomphosy</a>, and Gutenberg Product Architect <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/matveb/\">Matías Ventura</a>, who highlighted the advancements and upcoming milestones of the WordPress Project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One significant update shared during the keynote was the successful reactivation of WordCamps. This time last year, we organized eight in-person WordCamps, and by the end of 2022, the number had risen to 23. Thanks to the enthusiasm and involvement of the WordPress community, we are already on track to organize 25 WordCamps in the first half of this year alone.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha also emphasized the importance of the upcoming Community Summit on August 22-23. This in-person gathering brings contributors together across the WordPress open source project, fostering cross-project discussions vital for future growth and sustainability.

She also underscored the expansion of the WordPress ecosystem, citing examples like <a href=\"https://openverse.org/\">Openverse</a>, which now provides access to nearly 800 million images and audio files, all easily accessible in the Site Editor.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another exciting addition to the WordPress repertoire is <a href=\"https://playground.wordpress.net/\">WP Playground</a>. This new feature allows users to build WordPress applications instantly in the browser without needing a PHP server. This tool provides a swift and seamless experience, reducing the installation time from five minutes to a near-instantaneous 500 milliseconds. The application of WP Playground may seem like magic, but its practical application promises tangible and revolutionary benefits for WordPress users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matías Ventura then took the stage to share updates on Gutenberg. Through a visually stunning video built entirely with blocks, he showcased the six-year development journey and the transition from words to blocks to a final design. The upcoming WordPress version 6.3 will mark the completion of the first two phases of Gutenberg, consolidating all these features into a cohesive and user-friendly experience. He also highlighted the introduction of features such as the Wayfinder tool, Style Book, and the ability to save patterns, further empowering users to own their web presence and voice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following the keynote presentation, the WordPress leadership engaged in a<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzKiKRodHQ0\"> lively Q&amp;A session </a>with the audience, further illustrating the continuous evolution within the WordPress Project. This session highlighted how the WordPress community innovates, iterates, and continually improves to create a better platform for today and tomorrow.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VzKiKRodHQ0?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Join the global community and be part of the WordPress journey toward a brighter future!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Special thanks to <a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/cbringmann/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>cbringmann</a> and <a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/eidolonnight/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>eidolonnight</a> for review and collaboration</em>.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"15167\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"The Month in WordPress – May 2023\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2023/06/the-month-in-wordpress-may-2023/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 06 Jun 2023 10:15:56 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"Month in WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"month in wordpress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=15100\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:350:\"May has been a month of celebrating WordPress and the open source community that makes it possible.

Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>(Intro music)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:40]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the course of this year, there has been a lot of research and examination of the contributor funnel in the WordPress community. That research confirms some assumptions about what most contributor stories have in common: the hurdles, the general paths taken, and the way that problem-solving was done. Then in February of this year, Hari Shanker published a proposal for a mentorship program for WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now we&#8217;ve got a pilot program that&#8217;s been defined and is waiting for your feedback. If you&#8217;ve not read the post about the contributor mentorship program, for one do it. But if you would rather hear a synopsis from me, don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;m about to give you a 10-cent tour.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:22]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First up, who is doing this? This pilot program has been outlined by a community working group. We often have working groups in WordPress, and they almost always have specific projects around events or programs, or code updates. Since this working group is focused on a project-wide program, there is project-wide representation in it. All the names are at the bottom of the post, which you can find in our show notes. But it&#8217;s got folks who contribute with code or contribute with time or contribute with design folks who are self-sponsored or corporately sponsored, just a nice mix of people. The program as a whole, though, is being stewarded by Hari Shankar, a longtime supporter of and contributor to WordPress. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:02:06]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So next, what is this for? There are a few goals for the program. But the overarching goal is to increase the success of new contributors over time. We can all agree that if we were to have 1000s of new contributors every day, but they couldn&#8217;t find their way to impactful contributions or meaningful connections quickly, then we would have done them a disservice. And they probably won&#8217;t continue to be part of the community without a bit more effort.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The when and the where are essentially “right now and right here,” so that brings us finally to Why. Why are we doing this mentorship program? Apart from to help people who want to contribute have an easier path to success – which frankly is enough of a reason anyway – the why is wrapped up in our overall philosophies in the project. If we believe that good ideas can come from anywhere and that contributions of any size matter. And that open source is an idea that can change our generation and that we are democratizing publishing, then bringing new people brings new ideas, and beginner contributions can grow over time. We can maintain this idea, this concept of open source, into the next generation and to future generations. And always keep our sights on the open web. To learn more about this and other project-wide initiatives, swing by make.wordpress.org/project or check the links in today&#8217;s show notes on wordpress.org/news/podcast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:03:53]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which brings us now to our small list of big things.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:03:56]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First on the list is WordCamp Europe. That&#8217;s coming up at the end of the week on June 8 through 10th in Athens, Greece. There will be a major update from Matt and friends, so even if you aren&#8217;t there in person, keep an eye out for those recordings. But for those who are there and you&#8217;re curious about the mentorship program or anything else to do with WordPress and contributing to the project, you can come find me or Angela Jin, Hari will also be there, Chloé will be there, Héctor will be there, lots of people, and we want to hear your thoughts and answer your questions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:27]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second is a call for brainpower! A call for your brainstorms! On the subject of the next generation, we&#8217;ve got a discussion going on about the next generation of WordCamps. We&#8217;ve been discussing what new types and varieties might be available, and that might make sense for people as we get back to in-person events. So if you&#8217;ve got a kind of WordCamp that you&#8217;ve been desperately wanting to try, now&#8217;s the time to let folks know about it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:54]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the final thing is the second volume of The WordPress history book called Building Blocks: The Evolution of WordPress is now available for download in several formats as well as on GitHub.

His initial learning in the 1990s was through joining friends at a local pub where they could explore how websites were structured and learn to use chat software.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This led to Stefano creating websites for fun in 1998, and his first paid job was for the shop where he bought comics. He turned to content management systems (CMS) to speed up the creation process for sites, but found he needed more documentation to really understand their capabilities. Then he read a magazine article about WordPress, a CMS which was being used to make incredible blog sites, and was supported by an international community and documentation. Over time, Stefano started using that documentation to work on websites in Italian.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">WordPress provides a life-changing turning point&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Stefano describes himself as an introvert. He found that WordPress helped him to work from home, to develop his skills and the quality of what he could produce, as well as build his self-confidence.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A catalyst for the turning point in his life and career was the discovery of an area for events on the WordPress dashboard. On this page, he found a forthcoming local meetup in Rome.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In November 2017, Stefano took the step to go along to this event, led by a curiosity of what he might discover and intrigued by how a software could be supported by a vast community. The topic at the event was on <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/cli/\">WP-CLI</a>, a command line interface for WordPress. He recalled that he felt outside his comfort zone as he did not regard himself as a developer and at that point, had only used the software for simple jobs. He wondered whether using the software as his only CMS was going to be a long term option and if these meetups were suitable for him.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the meetup, people were talking about a forthcoming event, called WordCamp Rome. Through his research, he saw that there was a lot of enthusiasm for this event. This intrigued him and he wondered if it would show him that he could have a career using the software after all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfamiliar with WordCamps, Stefano found it difficult at first to know what he could go to and how to get involved, but he persevered and attended the event.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>&#8220;The WordCamp was a great discovery: talks at all levels from basic to those for developers, advanced and very advanced. I was immediately struck by the enthusiasm of the volunteers. It was an environment where I felt very comfortable, so much so, that I asked myself how I could participate in some WordCamps.&#8221;</p>\n<cite>Stefano Cassone</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>From this event, Stefano was encouraged by those he met to consider applying as a volunteer for a future WordCamp.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was also much talk at the event about ‘Slack’. It was new to Stefano, but with help from those attending, he signed up for the messaging tool Slack, used by the WordPress community. He was still unsure how he could contribute, and if he would be welcome.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Joining thousands of volunteer translators of WordPress</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/05/stefano-wc-italia-2022.jpg?resize=800%2C600&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Italian General Translation Editors at WordPress Italia 2022\" class=\"wp-image-15028\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/05/stefano-wc-italia-2022.jpg?w=800&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/05/stefano-wc-italia-2022.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/05/stefano-wc-italia-2022.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Italian General Translation Editors at WordPress Italia 2022</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Stefano took the plunge and was excited to find there was a team called Polyglots. In this team, people from across the world<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/\"> translate the WordPress software into many different languages</a>. He started with translating a theme he was using in his work. Little by little he became more interested in plugins and attended meetings with other translators. He offered his skills to translate into Italian themes and plugins in general and as his experience grew, he took on the volunteer role of a General Translation Editor. He also took care of the translation into Italian of the WordPress Core. More recently he has joined the group of translators for the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/docs/handbook/helphub/\">HelpHub</a>, which is part of the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/docs/\">WordPress documentation</a> system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said: “Participating in the WordPress Slack has helped me enormously: I’ve met a lot of people who I now call friends. Moreover, by translating, I learned a lot about how themes and plugins work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It&#8217;s a great way to contribute to WordPress, especially for someone like me who is not a developer. Translating also allows me to fully understand how WordPress works.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>&#8220;I always say that translating themes, plugins, and the Core software is the best way to learn WordPress, better than any course or book.”</p>\n<cite>Stefano Cassone</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sharing skills to support Open Source WordPress</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"667\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/05/stefano-at-WC-2019.jpg?resize=667%2C500&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Stefano volunteering as a photographer at a WordCamp in 2019 with other contributors.\" class=\"wp-image-15026\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/05/stefano-at-WC-2019.jpg?w=667&amp;ssl=1 667w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/05/stefano-at-WC-2019.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 667px) 100vw, 667px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Stefano volunteering as a photographer at a WordCamp in 2019 with other contributors.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Stefano’s growing commitment to the open source WordPress project was further boosted through his volunteering. He was a volunteer at WordCamp Rome 2018 and participated there in his first Contributor Day where he had the opportunity to translate the software with others.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He was also able to bring his own hobbies and skills to help the project grow and reach others. One example was his passion for photography, and he volunteered as a photographer for many other events in Italy organized by the WordPress community. He said: “This commitment to the community also allows me to have fun: being a photographer means having the opportunity to walk around the halls and capture moments of the life of a WordCamp.” The more WordCamps he attended, the more he wanted to be part of and keep contributing to the wider WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Contribution to WordPress is inspiring</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/05/stefano-at-the-support-table-contributor-day.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Stefano at the Support Table at a WordPress Contributor Day\" class=\"wp-image-15025\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/05/stefano-at-the-support-table-contributor-day.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/05/stefano-at-the-support-table-contributor-day.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/05/stefano-at-the-support-table-contributor-day.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/05/stefano-at-the-support-table-contributor-day.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Stefano at the Support Table at a WordPress Contributor Day</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>When Stefano was asked to become an organizer for the WordPress meetup in Rome in October 2019, he knew he wanted to be part of reaching and supporting more people in his area. He faced challenges with finding venues, but a greater issue was to come: the Covid-19 pandemic.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Spurred on by the <a href=\"https://it.wordpress.org/\">Italian WordPress community</a> as a whole, he was determined that the meetup was still needed. The regular event was transformed into an online meeting. He was able to gain help from people he had met as a volunteer to share their expertise with meetup attendees.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The community in Italy also worked together to put on WordCamp Italia online. It brought together the organizers of previous meetups and WordCamps, and new contributors too. Stefano volunteered in both online editions of this camp, including being part of the social and communication team. He found it to not only be a fun experience but also one that helped him grow professionally and learn from so many others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He went onto help restart the <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/romawordpress/\">Rome WordPress meetup</a> in-person meetings in May 2022, was an organizer for the third WordCamp Italy, and has been volunteering for camps in 2023.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What will WordPress bring you?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"533\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/05/stefano-at-a-wc.jpg?resize=533%2C800&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Stefano inspired by his journey at WordCamps asks what will WordPress bring you?\" class=\"wp-image-15024\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/05/stefano-at-a-wc.jpg?w=533&amp;ssl=1 533w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/05/stefano-at-a-wc.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 533px) 100vw, 533px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Stefano inspired by his journey at WordCamps asks what will WordPress bring you?</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>“Persona and professional growth and friendship” are some of the things they have brought Stefano. Contributing boosted his confidence and willingness to try new opportunities in his work.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said: “The best thing I got out of joining the WordPress community was the chance to collaborate with some people on a working basis and, I have to say, that was incredible. Being with many of them you have an incredible opportunity to grow in knowledge, you just have to be ready to learn. With WordPress you never stop learning.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His top recommendation is: “Join your local meetup or think about organizing one, it will introduce you to an amazing world. Don’t be afraid to meet people at WordCamps and Contributor Days, because you will learn more there than in dozens of courses. Talk to people at those events and don’t worry. The WordPress community is inclusive so you’ll always feel welcome, and you will see enthusiasm like you’ve never seen at other IT events.

The thousands of contributors who patched bugs and tested new features; organized events and fostered community; or wrote documentation and translated strings — how those contributions paved the road we travel today. A road that allows more people across the globe to use WordPress and contribute to WordPress, advancing the mission of democratizing publishing and giving us a little more freedom in the world.

These next steps for WordPress will ensure our legacy of creating useful, relevant, and reliable software remains strong while keeping in mind the core elements of our mission regarding accessibility, performance, and stability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By renewing our emphasis on the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/five-for-the-future/\">Five for the Future</a> program, and continuing to elevate our standing, we can make WordPress the household name it deserves to be.

In this instance, we have decided to cancel WordCamp Dhaka 2023.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The Community Team urged the Dhaka community to focus on collaborative organization, companies uplifting the community, and greater diversity in participation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an equally vague <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2023/07/03/incident-report-recent-cancelation-of-a-wordcamp/\">incident report</a> on WordPress.org, which doesn&#8217;t even identify the WordCamp that was cancelled, Community Team contributor Sam Suresh called it &#8220;an unfortunate but necessary decision.&#8221; He summarized the team&#8217;s reasons for the decision:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>The decision to cancel the event was not a result of inadequate planning or insufficient effort on the part of the organizing team. Instead, there were observable actions from local community members to influence decisions that would benefit specific individuals or companies. When this influence did not immediately lead to their desired results, the individuals aimed to undermine the organizing process and event success. While the Community Team took steps to mediate, the inappropriate behavior and actions we saw necessitated the cancelation. This is a rare and extreme decision and underscores the severity of the situation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Suresh said the issues applied to the local meetup group as well, and that all co-organizers and event organizers were removed from their roles and required to repeat their orientation to gain access again. A community deputy and a mentor were also removed from their roles in the project and the companies involved in the infractions were banned from sponsoring WordPress events for a year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;In times of challenges like these, it is important to remember that anyone can organize WordPress events regardless of who they work for and that WordPress community events are for the benefit of everyone, not any one business or individual,&#8221; Suresh said. &#8220;As a community, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/handbook/community-code-of-conduct/#our-expectations\">we will not tolerate harassment or influencing unacceptable behaviors</a>.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shortly after publishing, several community members commented with objections to the level of secrecy around the issues at hand and the people and companies involved. The Community Team&#8217;s nebulous posts on the matter seem to have further scandalized the situation, instead of offering clarity and transparency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This post definitely abides by the ongoing policy of not letting the community know who is being censured by the Community Services team, even in cases of egregious action,&#8221; WordPress marketing and meta contributor Sé Reed commented.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I’ve seen multiple cases of people filing harassment reports and various Code of Conduct violations, and that person/people have had various consequences, including being removed from organizing teams. However, those people then cite various reasons for leaving the team, often outright lying. But because of the secrecy around these cases, no one says otherwise and those people can and often do continue to operate in the community without any repercussions beyond secretly losing their &#8216;official&#8217; role(s).&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reed highlighted the damaging effects of the secrecy surrounding these incidents, most notably that explaining the situation often falls to those who filed the report, as the Community Team abdicates any further responsibility after validating the report.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This action is damaging to the community as a whole, as we do not have a full picture of who we are working with and we continue to unknowingly support and empower people who have not honored their community commitments,&#8221; Reed said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not all participants in the discussion were in favor of The Community Team identifying the individuals involved, but in this situation they demand to know the companies that were banned from sponsoring WordPress events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I’m on the fence about knowing peoples’ names here, but I think people definitely need to know the <strong>companies</strong> involved; actively trying to sabotage a WordPress WordCamp is a serious breach of trust for the community,&#8221; WebDevStudios Director of Engineering Mitch Cantor said. &#8220;Especially when they may turn around and then make money from that said community they tried to sabotage.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dealing with these types of sensitive situations is not an enviable task, but the community, for whom these decisions are designed to serve, is calling for a greater level of transparency regarding those who act in ways that are not aligned with WordPress&#8217; globally shared values.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;One way or the other, protecting folks who have violated the Community Code of Conduct is a policy that very clearly needs to be revisited,&#8221; Reed said.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 03 Jul 2023 19:11:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:40:\"WordPress.org blog: WordPress 6.3 Beta 3\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=15340\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2023/07/wordpress-6-3-beta-3/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5894:\"<p>WordPress 6.3 Beta 3 is ready for download and testing!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This version of the WordPress software is under development.</strong> <strong>Please do not install, run, or test this version on production or mission-critical websites.</strong> Instead, it is recommended you evaluate Beta 3 on a test server and site. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Get an overview of the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/6-3/\">6.3 release cycle</a>, and check the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\">Make WordPress Core blog</a> for <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/6-3/\">6.3-related posts</a> in the coming weeks for further details.

Last week <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/hackers-actively-exploiting-unpatched-privilege-escalation-vulnerability-in-ultimate-member-plugin\">WPScan reported that Ultimate Member had still not fully patched the vulnerability</a> after multiple inadequate attempts. There was evidence that it was being actively exploited in the wild.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Working through the complexities of this security issue, WPScan researcher Marc Montpas opened a <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/58679#ticket\">ticket</a> on WordPress trac, identifying an issue with the meta key field in the usermeta table using accent insensitive collations:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>Looking at the latest string of vulnerability issues that came up related to the Ultimate Member plugin I discovered that the usermeta table has an accent insensitive collation for the <code>meta_key</code> field. This results in queries for <code>wp_cãpăbilitiës</code> to return the actual <code>wp_capabilities</code> row! See <code>update_metadata()</code> function in wp-includes/meta.php</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Imagine the attack surface this brings. In fact, don&#8217;t imagine, just look at the recent attacks in the wild.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>This particular issue made it more difficult to fully patch the vulnerability in question. Ultimate Member released version 2.6.7 on July 1, 2023, which whitelists for metakeys the plugin stores while sending forms. The plugin&#8217;s security advisory details a few other changes that may affect third-party developers:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>2.6.7 also separates form settings data and submitted data and operates them in 2 different variables. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[It] includes some significant changes to how forms submissions are handled. This may cause 3rd-party modifications to stop working. For Third-party developers, please update your customizations to support the new changes in the latest version</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimate Member recommends users review and delete any unknown administrator accounts, reset all user passwords including the admin, enable SSL and backups, and send any advisories to site members and/or customers about the incident. The plugin&#8217;s developers are working on releasing a feature inside the plugin that will enable the website admin to reset passwords for all users, but it is still being finalized:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>The reason for this is a site using our plugin may have been hacked or injected with malware that sniffs login inputs, because this vulnerability issue is prone to these attacks, we recommend to reset passwords after updating with a security patch. This is to ensure the best protection for your website user’s passwords.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>All Ultimate Member users should update to the latest available version, 2.6.7, which has the patch for the vulnerability. The plugin&#8217;s developers are awaiting more feedback from WPScan and are evaluating all their extensions to ensure they are secure. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 03 Jul 2023 16:22:27 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"WordPress.org blog: WP Briefing: Episode 59: A Polyglot’s WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?post_type=podcast&p=15281\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2023/07/episode-59-a-polyglots-wordpress/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30292:\"<p>Join WordPress Executive Director Josepha Haden Chomphosy in the 59th episode of the WordPress Briefing.

Can you, let&#8217;s, because I bet that not a lot of people know who you are, can you first start by just telling me a bit about your work with WordPress, and then let us know what GlotPress is, for those of us who don&#8217;t know yet?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:01:19]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. So, Automattic sponsors me to work in the WordPress project on the Meta team and on the Polyglots team. So I spent time on improving or helping improve the software that powers the translation on WordPress.org. But I also work on the meta team on things like Matrix and evaluating if it would be a good fit for WordPress to switch to Matrix for their chat system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:01:46]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So a lot of really big projects that you work on, all of that kind of stuff that has no easy solutions anymore, is where you are right now. Huh?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:01:56]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, there&#8217;s no clear path, but it&#8217;s our mission to find it. So that&#8217;s part of what makes things interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:02:05]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cool. So for folks who don&#8217;t know too much about the Polyglots team or generally translating WordPress, the software, can you let us know a bit about what GlotPress is?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:02:16]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right. So the translation system that powers WordPress.org is called GlotPress. It used to be a standalone software that was developed a couple of years ago, and it was transformed into a WordPress plugin at some point, and now powers the translation that happens on WordPress.org. So we translate WordPress core there from English to other languages, plugins, themes, block patterns, and it all happens through this software called GlotPress. There are a couple GlotPress installations around the world, but I think the WordPress.org one is one of the bigger ones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:02:55]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Probably, WordPress.org is pretty, pretty massive. Also, I think it&#8217;s great that you said that GlotPress was created a couple of years ago, like that, that indicates to me that you&#8217;re working on a really different timescale than a lot of folks are in WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:03:10]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So Alex, tell me a little bit about what it takes to ship translated WordPress software. So, I mean, for people who don&#8217;t need translated WordPress, like obviously we don&#8217;t have a good idea of what it takes to make sure that WordPress is available in so many languages. So what goes into the work of making sure that that happens?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:03:32]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right, so typically the WordPress software and plugins and themes are primarily created in English. And for it to be available in other languages, it needs to be translated. And for that to be able to happen, the programmers need to make the software translatable. Basically, they&#8217;re providing each English string for the translation software to be available to be transformed, so to speak, into another language and to what it&#8217;s being transformed to. This is what the translators do. So they go into the GlotPress software and see the list of texts that need to be translated and translate it to their language that they speak. Typically there is a process around this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:03:32]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, we&#8217;ve got people who have lots of experience in translation. And specifically in translating WordPress or WordPress plugins. And they&#8217;re kind of the, the people who help ensure good quality of translation. So anybody who&#8217;s working the WordPress project, so basically who has a WordPress.org account, can come in and address the translation. And that translation enters the system, so to speak, in a waiting state. And then somebody who we promoted to be a Translation Editor will come along and take a look at your translation and will approve it or will give you suggestions how to do the translation in a better way, or come up with maybe even a better translation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:05:03]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, when you have like a small thing that&#8217;s just not right, like a missing full stop or something like that. They might just add it for you. And well, as soon as the plugin or software is translated to a certain level of translations those translations will be shipped out to the WordPress installs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:05:20]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, for example, for a plugin, you would reach 90% of translated strings. Those translations will then be basically packed up into zip file, a language pack and delivered to each WordPress so that you can have the translations available there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:05:35]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And is 90% the threshold for plugins only, or is that also the threshold for like themes and the CMS itself?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:05:34]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well. We strive for 100%, I would say.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:05:47]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Good. <em>( laughs )</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:05:48]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, 90% more of a motivational point. To be actually honest, I&#8217;m not sure if the threshold is 90% for every project or even if it&#8217;s actually 90%. It&#8217;s different between different GlotPress installations and it&#8217;s basically something that is made as a setting that can be changed. There&#8217;s, it&#8217;s an arbitrary number. Typically you&#8217;d actually want to make sure that the most important strings are translated first. So the ones like, if you look at the whole picture, software usually consists of many parts, many of whom are not encountered by people on a regular basis. For example, error messages that could be like obscure error messages, and you could argue that those might be not as important. Or even sometimes you could even say like, do they need to be translated? Because if you encounter an error message and you search the internet, wouldn&#8217;t you probably want everybody to search for the English one to find the solution? But that set-aside, it&#8217;s important to have like the headline of the plugin or like the most important strings translated, and typically translating those most important strings will take you to a pretty high percentage so that we can then say it&#8217;s good enough to be shipped.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:07:02]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gotcha. I see, I see. Okay. Well, we talked a bit earlier about GlotPress&#8217;s timeline. It has been around for a bit, I know. But with that kind of in mind, have there been any notable changes to GlotPress recently?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:07:19]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, so I think for GlotPress there&#8217;s been a bit of an up and down over time in terms of engagement and progress on the software. But in, in the recent year, I think we&#8217;ve added a couple of things that have been very helpful for translators. So one of them was adding the commenting functionality, so yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:07:35]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Super helpful. Shocked it wasn&#8217;t there before. Sorry, translators. Sorry, all of our polyglots.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:07:40]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, it can be like there was when GlotPress was created there, there is like the, a big part of GlotPress are these states, like the waiting state when you enter translation, and then there&#8217;s approved state, which basically a translation we say it&#8217;s set to current, and there&#8217;s all sorts of process around it. So if the software is updated or translation might get fuzzy. But also like, if somebody submits a translation that doesn&#8217;t fully conform to what&#8217;s the translation editors, or like what the standards of the translation community have been set to, then you would have to need to reject it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:08:16]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that has been something that we felt wasn&#8217;t a very good and enticing way of telling people like, we appreciate your work. It wasn&#8217;t just quite right, but it&#8217;s more of a rejection. So this is how we came up with this like, let&#8217;s give people the option to say what was wrong and give them a chance to try again without making them feel rejected.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:08:38]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Sort of a &#8220;No, but&#8230;&#8221; as opposed to a, just refusal to receive it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:08:45]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And other things that we&#8217;ve worked on is, like, with the recent search of AI, like getting help from AI on translation and also on reviews. So, there&#8217;s some interesting things that you can do with AI in that regard; that one important aspect of translations, it&#8217;s also that we&#8217;ve got glossaries for each language where people, basically the translation community, identifies certain words they want to translate them the same way every time.&nbsp;And with the AI, you can basically add to the prompt, like, please translate those words to those translations when you give me a translation for that. And as it can change over time, you can always adapt this to the prompt, and that has been proven quite helpful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:09:25]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is great. That&#8217;s one of those things I know that AI has been like a really popular thing to talk about. And AI, specifically for translations, I think has caused some concern that maybe we&#8217;ll just like translate it all and hope that computers get it right when we know pretty certainly that computers don&#8217;t always get the translations right. But that&#8217;s not what you&#8217;re talking about, right? What you&#8217;re suggesting is that AI would suggest what could be translated and what it could be translated to, and then human beings have to confirm that that&#8217;s correct, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:09:59]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s exactly it. So basically, we give suggestions to the translators, and then they can modify a translation before they press save. It&#8217;s more of a, like supporting them in getting the translations, like looking up words more quickly and all of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:10:16]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s wonderful. So is that the major sort of next step that is coming for GlotPress, or are there other things that we should keep an eye out for in that software?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:10:27]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So one direction that we&#8217;ve been taking GlotPress is basically making use of the fact that GlotPress is WordPress plugin now. And you know, typically, you would just use a GlotPress install. So on WordPress.Org, there&#8217;s like GlotPress installed, there&#8217;s translation projects created, something that we call &#8220;translation sets&#8221;. So for languages, you want to translate it to, it&#8217;s all pre-configured, and if you would install GlotPress to plugin on your own WordPress, it would be empty and not very useful. So what we&#8217;ve added is a way for you to basically be able to translate the plugins and themes that you&#8217;ve got installed in your WordPress into the language that you&#8217;re interested in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:11:07]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you might have a non-English website that you want to use certain plugins with, and they might not be fully translated at this point, so obviously, you could go to WordPress.org and help translate them, and that&#8217;s the way to, that&#8217;s preferred. But you could also now go install GlotPress on your own website and translate there. And then you have the translations there right when you enter them. And you can then contribute those translations back to WordPress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:11:35]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s with local GlotPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:11:37]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s something that we call local GlotPress. And you know, since we then have all these translations in the local database, it means we can do even more with those translations. So typically, language packs would be delivered to WordPress, but with local GlotPress, you&#8217;ve got like all the GlotPress software there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:11:56]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we can do things like inline translation. So, on your own WordPress and wp-admin, for example, we can highlight all the strings that can be translated, and those strings just have to right-click them and enter your translation, and that way, you can basically go about and translate the whole ui, seeing your progress, as you&#8217;re making, basically turning the screen from red to green.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:12:20]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Yeah. So that&#8217;s something now that you can do in your local WordPress installation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:12:26]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Basically, it&#8217;s completely independent of WordPress.org. We would ask you to contribute the translations back when you have them, but being independent also allows you to translate like premium plugins, which could not be hosted on WordPress.org or doing something like that we call like hyper-local translation. So, for example, I speak Austrian German natively, but even inside Austria, we&#8217;ve got different dialects or like special words that we use. And if I wanted to create a website that&#8217;s targeted at the Viennese market, for example, I might want to use those specific terms. And this is something I would have to argue for those translations to be accepted on WordPress.org because it&#8217;s a, it&#8217;s like a very targeted market. But if I have a local GlotPress, I can do those translations there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:13:11]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That seems awfully beneficial, especially as dialects. I&#8217;ve been having these conversations. I have, in my extended family, many children, and they are all learning languages and one of them has been having kind of thoughts about, like, dialects and how dialects are almost another language. And if so, like how do you know what everybody&#8217;s saying when you&#8217;re speaking all the same thing, but it&#8217;s kind of a little bit it sounds a little bit different.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:13:37]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s certainly a thing in the US, the distinct dialects across our country. And so I imagine that that&#8217;s gonna be a really beneficial sort of implementation for countries that have a lot of different regional variations and certainly smaller countries that have technically the same language as somebody else, but a lot of regional differences, regional specific things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:14:01]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is that the same or different as the live translations, Translate Live, that we talked about at the WordCamp Europe a couple weeks back?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:14:12]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right. So, Translate Live is kind of the next step after local GlotPress. It&#8217;s like this happy marriage between the WordPress Playground and local GlotPress. So the WordPress Playground is also something that has come up a lot. It&#8217;s basically a way for you to run WordPress inside a browser window, so in JavaScript. And at first, it seems like mildly interesting, I would say. But when you combine it with other things like local GlotPress, it can lead to really interesting opportunities. So with inline translation, for example, on WordPress.org, you would typically find for every plugin, the UI would look the same. You would have a table of strings, and all that makes you realize you&#8217;re translating this certain plugin is that in the header of the page, it says this name of the plugin, but other than that, it can look really all the same.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:15:07]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now, with WordPress Playground, you can put up a WordPress and run this plugin inside that Playground. And now, if you add local GlotPress to the picture, you can also do the inline translation of that plugin inside the WordPress Playground. So you&#8217;ve got inline translation. We add the glossary so they do make sure that you translate things the same way that they&#8217;re expected, and you don&#8217;t have to install the plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:15:33]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And still, you can see what the translations will look like. You can see the strings next to each other, and what I think is most important, you will start with the strings that you see first, which are the most important ones. When you&#8217;re in the table view, those strings might be somewhere buried in the middle, and yeah, it&#8217;s really hard to see progress if you start with kind of obscure error messages, for example, versus just starting with the things that you see first.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:16:02]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. So, moving translations away from table-based translations where you kind of have to know what you&#8217;re looking for. So the Translate Live, along with local GlotPress, along with WP Playground, is going to make it so that it&#8217;s easier to see visually what needs to be translated, where, what&#8217;s most valuable to translate for your mid users and your end users, basically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:16:30]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That, and also like for plug-in authors, it can be really good to see, you know, you can switch the languages in the Playground to another language, and you can quickly see like what&#8217;s the state of the translation in this language or in that language. And even things like, you know, Arabic as an RTL language rights to left language. The sidebar will change to the right, and you can also just switch language and see like, what&#8217;s my plugin like in this environment. I mean, this is not technically something that&#8217;s related to local GlotPress, but in this translation live ui, it&#8217;s very easy to change languages and see your plugin in another language.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:17:06]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, it&#8217;s not specifically related to, to Translations Live, but also, I think that if we&#8217;re saying that WordPress not necessarily is going to lead the way with translations and native multilingual support in our CMS because, of course, it&#8217;s still a little bit far out on our roadmap. We certainly have an opportunity to have the best implementation of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:17:27]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And even if like that specific use case that you&#8217;re talking about isn&#8217;t related directly to what it is that you are working on for Polyglots and inside GlotPress and all of that, I do see that having more streamlined, more easy to see and access opportunities to like test the way that our software looks across varying environments, especially those that change it substantially from what we typically work in day-to-day for any individual developer or any individual WordPress site implementer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:18:00</strong>]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, I think that that is a big step forward for all of us and certainly for anyone who is having to use WordPress as not a native English speaker. And so you say it&#8217;s not related, but it still is a big, a big benefit for WordPress overall, I think, to have this kind of work happening so that we can have those benefits to the folks who are using our software.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:18:22]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there were a couple of different things that you mentioned over the course of our conversation. We&#8217;re gonna put some links to the show notes for all of those. But one thing that you mentioned that just kind of went by, and we never really had an opportunity to talk about it. You talked about the, I think it was GTEs, Global Translation Editors, the folks that are like approved as final approvers of translations. If there is someone who&#8217;s listening to this podcast who wants to become a GTE someday, where would they go to do that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:18:54]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the path to GTE is a PTE.&nbsp;<em>( laughs )</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:18:59]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, we&#8217;ve got different levels of translation editors. Basically, you start, you could say you start off as a translator, and this is how you can kind of show that you can do good translations or that you&#8217;re very firm in your language. And this might make you be noticed in the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:19:16]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we&#8217;re always looking for people who like to help with translations. And you might be then promoted to be a Project Translation Editor. Basically, it means that for a single language in a project, you&#8217;ll be able to approve translations. So, you&#8217;ll be the one who says, like, this translation is a good one and this conforms to the to the rules that we have stated as a translation community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:19:42]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And further down the path then is the GTE, where you basically are allowed to approve translations across any project on translate.WordPress.org in your language. And that&#8217;s, usually you&#8217;ll be in, in that position with other GTEs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:20:04]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there is, like, in each community, there is like, we&#8217;re people based. We talk about what might be a good translation. We talk to each other, try to find rules that maybe prevent common mistranslations, or set the standards for how we want the software to be translated. And this is something where you get a voice as a translator, but as a GTE, you get into a position where you can actually make the changes or find consensus on how the software should be translated in your language.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:20:35]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if folks are not familiar where the Polyglots team works and meets, where would they find you all?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:20:41]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>At make.WordPress.org/polyglots.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:20:45]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perfect. Alex, this has been such a fascinating conversation. Thank you so much for joining me today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:20:50]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you very much.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>( Intermission music )</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:20:59]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that brings us now to our small list of big things. First, WP Campus 2023 is taking place July 12th through the 14th. That&#8217;s a nonprofit three-day conference with topics that focus on the growth of higher education, accessibility, WordPress, and anyone who works in higher education.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:21:17]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a hybrid event. There is an in-person component on the beautiful campus of Tulane University in New Orleans, Louisiana.

In today&#8217;s episode, we will talk about Gutenberg 6.1, WordPress 6.3 and that&#8217;s pretty much it. We have a full program alone with that. I&#8217;m your host, Birgit Pauli-Haack, curator at the Gutenberg Times and full-time core contributor for WordPress open source project sponsored by Automattic. And I&#8217;m so happy that Tammie Lister joins me today. She&#8217;s one of the Gutenberg design leads of phase one and design lead of WordPress 6.3 release squad and will be the editor tech co-lead on the all underrepresented gender squad for 6.4. In her day job Tammie works at the global agency Inpsyde from Germany as a developer. Good afternoon, Tammie. So happy to see you again. Thank you so much for making the time to be on the show. How are you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: I am great. Thank you so much for having me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Oh, it&#8217;s so wonderful. And for our longtime listeners, you are no stranger. You&#8217;ve been on the Gutenberg Live Q&amp;A few years ago, and you were part of the last year&#8217;s developer hours, and it&#8217;s actually the first time that you&#8217;re on the podcast. How did that happen? For those of you listening for the first time, tell me a little bit about your WordPress work and what you&#8217;re doing now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: So my WordPress journey has been a long one and an awesome one. Like a lot of people, I started out by blogging and poking around themes and then I worked for a long time on the problems with themes, went via core through BuddyPress and then for a long time I worked as creating themes and working through that. And that&#8217;s where I started really my contribution journey through the theme review team and a little bit in core. And then Gutenberg, I guess it was my adventure by Gutenberg. The seed of Gutenberg is rooted in a lot of people from the theming background. It&#8217;s one of those not so hidden facts about Gutenberg, that a lot of people who worked on it had that background as well. And I&#8217;ve been really lucky since I worked on that project, to have quite an adventure working in various roles from design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And at the moment, I&#8217;m really lucky to be balancing back my developer skills. I&#8217;ve always done both, but at the moment I&#8217;m really focusing on how can I raise back up those skills, and I&#8217;m really lucky to be doing that in an agency role. So I am now getting to work with this amazing thing that we&#8217;ve created in the editor and getting to implement it within the agency at a development level so that I&#8217;m having all sorts of fun now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, I can imagine that. That&#8217;s awesome. Well, thank you so much and yes, so you will have opinions about the extensibility of Gutenberg, which is one of the top…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: Only a few.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: That will come or that has been in the background or in the other current of all the new features, where&#8217;s the extensibility or how can we extend this?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Announcements</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So before we dive into the recent releases, I want to tell you dear listeners all about the two live Q&amp;As that are coming up in July. So next week, we have on July 6, 2023 at 17:00 UTC and I&#8217;m not going to convert this to any other time right now. Time zones are the bane of my existence at the moment. So we have the topic, leveraging Gutenberg&#8217;s architecture to take plugin development to new levels, and we learn about how Gutenberg components and scripts can be used outside the block editor to revamp a plugins code base.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this is a case study of GiveWP 3.0, how that&#8217;s come about and we will have a guest, Jason Adams, who&#8217;s the director of development and Jon Waldstein, who&#8217;s the lead developer on the show. And my co-host will be Lena Morita who is a JavaScript developer on the components team. So she has some really geeky questions for the two and she&#8217;s quite excited about it, and I&#8217;m really looking forward to it because I find it fascinating when developers discover all the ways to use existing components and script to build on top of Gutenberg. And it saves so much development time and it opens up new synergies between the core and the added functionality in a plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you&#8217;re interested to dive in, the next one, two weeks later on July 21st, also at 17:00 UTC, we will hold the next live Q&amp;A with designers and developers of WordPress VIP, and they created a bridge plugin between Figma design themes and the theme JSON file for the classic and block themes. And it&#8217;s a fascinating way to keep faithful to the existing design systems and start spinning up new sites that mirror that design system without a whole lot of friction in between us. My co-host will be Joni Halabe from the web team at Georgetown University, also a very interesting live Q&amp;A. I&#8217;m really happy that we&#8217;re putting it together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The last one, you have to just subscribe to the newsletter so you get early access to it, newsletter at the Gutenberg Times and should you listen to this episode, I know a lot of people binge listen to it. If you listen to this episode after July 22nd, check out the Gutenberg Times YouTube channel for the recordings of that. We always record them, we have them transcribed, we have a post on the Gutenberg Times with the resources shared and all that. So even if you miss it, but the live Q&amp;A is really interesting because all of a sudden from the demos that are there, there comes these very quick questions from the audience and I really like having that a live show. So that&#8217;s that.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What’s Released &#8211; WordPress 6.3</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We are coming to the what&#8217;s released section and we come to what happened last night. So today, we are recording it on Thursday, June 28th and this morning in I think 1:30, WordPress 6.3 beta two was released. And were you up at that time?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: No, I got up as far as about just hitting 11:00 UK time at night and I could see it wasn&#8217;t going to be the 11:00, so I left the amazing people that were doing and I&#8217;d kept going that far, and I bowed out and got some sleep because it was the second night running.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, there was a second shift coming in from Australia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: Which is amazing. That&#8217;s part of the global project. We all get to open doors and close doors after each other, leave post-it notes virtually up for each other. There was a lot of that going on for the past two days and I think that&#8217;s the important thing. It&#8217;s been two days we&#8217;ve been working to get this out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, the make blog has one was the delay for one day and then also the explanation why it&#8217;s now called beta two instead of beta one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: Systems are hard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Systems are hard, releases are hard. I have switched my role for this release from doing for three releases, dev notes wrangling to actually be editor triage, co-lead with four other people. And this has been quite an interesting experience because all of a sudden, I&#8217;m looking behind the scenes and how timely a lot of PRs are to getting into the beta. And then it&#8217;s not only that there&#8217;s in the plugin, but you also need to sync the core data, the PHP code with the Gutenberg code and that is another big adventure for the tech leads. And you get to do this, when is it? In September before beta 6.4.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: Yeah. And I think you never know the unknowns until you know them and then you document, and then you try and that&#8217;s the important part of this amazing journey that is these big projects. You can predict most things but it&#8217;s always going to be the thing that you don&#8217;t predict. Honestly, we are doing incredible. Everyone is doing incredible. We just have to remember humans’ need to sleep sometimes and I think that is the beauty we learn. One of the amazing things we do now, which we didn&#8217;t do before is we have the use of the time zones. We use that. We have multiple leads. I think back even a few years ago, we didn&#8217;t have that for these roles and by having that, we can take advantage of time zones and lives and different people, but just documenting and writing, I think there&#8217;s going to be some like, &#8220;Okay, so that could happen.&#8221; Okay, now we document this, now we learn this and that&#8217;s great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s stuff I now want to learn about. My curious brain is like, &#8220;Okay, well this went wrong. Okay, so how do we learn?&#8221; And that&#8217;s great because our documentation gets better. That&#8217;s generally what happens in between releases where people debrief and then take everything that happened in a release and then the next release gets better each time. We rise on the past release each time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Right, yeah. As you know, this big project, nobody really knows everything. So the collaborative effort is…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: And if they claim to, I really think they need to go for a little walk in the countryside and think about themselves because nobody does and that&#8217;s amazing. You&#8217;ve just got to be very humble and just go, &#8220;Okay, on we go.&#8221; I just wanted to say shout out to everyone that was working so hard the past 48 hours and then some. You saw some beautiful handovers of patches, people just teleporting in on their phones and doing things and just some amazing open source hearts. You saw a lot of that going on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And I saw a lot of also the humbleness stuff. I don&#8217;t know, does somebody else is able to help me?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: I don&#8217;t know, but I might know someone who does in their mental Rolodex going through a list of people, and that&#8217;s amazing to do. It&#8217;s not like I might know, I&#8217;m going to struggle with it for a while and then I&#8217;m not going to come up with a good solution. That does not help anybody.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: No, no, no. At that moment, you need somebody who knows. But it&#8217;s also…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tammie Lister: It would help otherwise you make it worse. It&#8217;s like the I will fix this and make it worse. Nobody needs that at 10:00 at night.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Not on a software that&#8217;s used by millions of people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: But a beta is a beta. And I think that&#8217;s the amazing thing we all have to&#8230; Now, let&#8217;s test it now let&#8217;s poke it and do things and nothing is ever going to be bug free. We always want that, but we do our best every time. I am so excited about how big this changelog is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, we&#8217;re getting to that. But I just wanted to do a shout-out for Brian Alexander who&#8217;s heading the test team. He has put together some amazing instructions on how you can make really impactful contributions to this open source project and we will share the link in the show notes. So when you go to the test <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/2023/06/27/help-test-wordpress-6-3/\">make.webpress.org/test</a>, that&#8217;s the first post that will come up is help test WordPress 6.3. There are quite a few features coming in and they all need testing and they all need hitting the real life scenarios. Have plugins that use some of that, themes, just poke it from all the ends and it&#8217;s really necessary. And like every beta, it&#8217;s beta, but the bugs that we find now in the beta two, three and four, we don&#8217;t have to fix later when the release is done. So yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Gutenberg 16.1</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>What also was released was Gutenberg 16.1 and that&#8217;s when 255 PRs merged with this release by 69 contributors and it&#8217;s just amazing what all went in there. It&#8217;s also understandable because if it went for the last minute, nothing really gets done in life, I found. And everybody wanted to get their work merged, so it will be in the next WordPress release and with the beta this week, it&#8217;s the last plugin release for enhancements and new features to come in. After that, it&#8217;s all bug fixing. So that made it for a mile long changelog. And Tammie and I will do our best to pick the stars amongst the 255, the bright shining stars and the highlights for you and talk them through. So do you want to hit us off with the first thing or do you have any other comments to add?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: Wow, the amount. I guess the first one would be the navigation menu sidebar, the renaming, duplication, and deleting of navigation menus from browse mode sidebar. Navigation menu sidebar, the maturity of that in general, it feels such a long adventure the navigation menu has come on and I think that&#8217;s also maybe this point is why there was so much as well. It&#8217;s not the final-final release, it&#8217;s like Photoshop when you name a final-final 01 file or something, but it&#8217;s a closure and I think having a navigation block, having things changed, all these things, it&#8217;s a closure for a lot of these features. So I think navigation, it feels like quite a closure on some of these things as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And it now made real sense. I think it really needed to gruel it and often and throw out concepts and get new ones there. So there&#8217;s navigation and then there is the sidebar menu in the site editor that also has a navigation piece to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: But bringing that functionality means that you then&#8230; There&#8217;s this weird separation, but it allows that to feel more cohesive and native. That&#8217;s the best words I can think of it. I think navigation&#8217;s going to take a little while to get a lot of people using because navigation&#8217;s over here and all these kinds of things. It&#8217;s that maturity of that feature and the dependability of that feature and the work there. I&#8217;ve definitely started feeling that it feels more robust to use with these changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: It&#8217;s pretty exciting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And I finally feel the same way. I was always a little hesitant to touch the navigation because I knew it wasn&#8217;t finished. So I didn&#8217;t want…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: You sneeze near it, it&#8217;ll fall over, bless it. And I say that having worked on it myself, but it&#8217;s just a really hard problem. Turns out navigation&#8230; Linking alone is a hard problem, but navigation is linking plus plus plus. It&#8217;s a really difficult problem. If you just write code, it felt easier. But if soon as you add any interface, it&#8217;s really difficult.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And it&#8217;s also such a prominent piece of a website that you build, that it really needs to…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: And people are very bonded to a particular way of using navigation in WordPress as well. So we&#8217;ve got to retrain that mindset.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, that definitely is true. And so we have the navigation and the sidebar and the site editor as a navigation menu where you can do certain things and from that menu, from that sidebar, you already can rename, duplicate menus, or delete them. You cannot create them. That&#8217;s what you do when you create, you add a navigation block to a template part to the header or to the footer and then on the right hand sidebar on the white sidebar, that&#8217;s where you assemble your menu or the many menus.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: I like that consciousness of creating them somewhere else. There there&#8217;s so many opinions on separation and workflows. I feel like&#8230; This is a complete personal opinion, but making navigation too easy, I think that you end up with too many navigation everywhere. That&#8217;s always been one of our problems, that you end up with people drowning in menus. So I think that there&#8217;s a balance that there&#8217;s a maturity of navigation. I think that&#8217;s where the overlap of this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, definitely. And I like that in the site editor left side navigation, you just touch on the overall website, but you always go into the canvas to actually make changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: The best words I can use is assembly there. I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s a good word, but it feels like assembly there, functionality doing here. And then that&#8217;s what it feels like. The different mental models that I&#8217;m moving in between when I&#8217;m doing things and I&#8217;m for that, different areas having very distinct different mental models when I&#8217;m doing it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And I like that too because I can&#8217;t have two different thoughts in my head at the same time and be productive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: Life&#8217;s too short.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. So that&#8217;s why I like the next item, that the footnotes block is now coming to text blocks and that&#8217;s really something that we have all been waiting for a long time. And I know that Ella van Durpe has also tried multiple ways to get this done and I think she has such great ideas that she all pursued them all. And in the GitHub, you can have the history of all the footnotes, but I think this version is really hitting it out of the park. It works well. You put the cursor where you need the footnote, you get it from the menu from the inside menu bar menu dropdown on the block toolbar, and then you say footnote, and then it gets you right into the place where the content of the footnote, you can add that and it does the numbering itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you say, &#8220;Oh, I put a footnote in the middle of a paragraph, but also I need another one on top of it,&#8221; it recounts them so automatically. So that&#8217;s a really good feature. And it has color controls, but it also follows whatever your paragraph or your link color is. I just see that when you change the background of a paragraph, you get what you always get with links is if you change the text, you also need to change the link color. But that is something that&#8217;s the nature of the beast and there is no automation for that. But I&#8217;m really happy that this block comes and it will be in 6.3.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: Footnotes has an adventure for many years. I think footnotes is one of those, to me, it&#8217;s a sign of maturity for an editor. Quite a few see it as extra functionality or features. But it really is something that if you are in a particular field or you are particularly using, that you will not use an editor unless it has the footnotes functionality. It&#8217;s whether you choose to use or not. There&#8217;s no doubt whether you would want, you wouldn&#8217;t even have a plugin. It would be base functionality. So I think I am very glad to see it. Also, it&#8217;s a really strong indicator of things like collaboration. It sets that. It may not feel like it, but it is. It sets those using that canvas in a little bit of a different way as well. So I&#8217;m really pleased to see it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: And that experimenting outside to then bring in, I think is a real good way forward to start seeing the interface as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, definitely. Definitely. And then you could actually move the footnotes block where all the footnotes are to the end of things or put them a little bit further. So it&#8217;s also quite versatile.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: That&#8217;s really important depending on what article you&#8217;re writing as well. I do not claim to know any different medical whatever articles, but I&#8217;m sure that there are certain rules and regulations around where things go and depending on articles and what order things go. So having that functionality that you can determine yourself is better for everybody.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: The next big one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yep, go ahead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: I feel like there&#8217;s a whole episode here on patterns and I guess the big one here is the naming and language to me is&#8230; Again, we talk about maturity, well renaming reusable blocks, rename to my patterns and add option to also add a non-synced pattern. This is big, it&#8217;s a small big thing I guess because it&#8217;s a big thing, but it&#8217;s not a massive feature, is it? But it also is a massive feature. Reusable blocks are quite limited but really quite bonded for some people. So I think that we got to respect that. But patterns to me are what everyone always wanted with reasonable blocks. When everyone describes what they want from a reusable block, it&#8217;s a mature functional pattern that has all the things that patterns are getting like syncing, all these things. And that&#8217;s what patterns are getting now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I don&#8217;t know what you feel, but that to me it&#8217;s just maturity of patterns, you have blocks, patterns, template parts, templates. It makes sense.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Oh yeah, yeah. They&#8217;re pretty much cut from the same cloth and all had different names and also different models. So you had to get here for template parts, you need to go there for a reusable block and you had a pattern here, but they all had different updates kind of thing. So if you update a reusable block, it updates on all instances. A pattern doesn&#8217;t have any updates, so every time you put them into a canvas, they are all disintegrating. They don&#8217;t know about itself anymore. But what I like is that you now can create your own patterns and that is something that a lot of people were missing, that you were dependent on the pattern directory or you were dependent on the theme to provide your patterns or some third-party directory where you can copy paste it over, but you are not able to say, &#8220;Oh, this is a marvelous pattern. Can I store that on my site?&#8221; And now you can.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s the same interface or same workflow that you are accustomed to when you create a reusable block and there&#8217;s only one change there&#8230; Well, one attribute, it&#8217;s called sync this over all the instances, yes or no, it&#8217;s a toggle switch. So if you switch it on, you get a reusable block that if you change it, it changes all the instances. And if you switch it not on, it&#8217;s a pattern which does not update. But this is also, and you say, &#8220;Okay, but I want, when I change the style of my pattern, I want it to be replicated over all the instances.&#8221; It&#8217;s coming. This is the first step. This is the first step to unify the wording, unify the interface. And then also, you don&#8217;t have this duplicate mental model anymore. You find them and you can edit them at the same spaces. It&#8217;s called my custom patterns. That&#8217;s how you find them in the pattern list. And then in the block when you highlight them, there is manage your patterns. So it&#8217;s a great step and it&#8217;s one that we have been really all waiting for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: And putting my agency hat on, really trying to explain all this language. People, they work in design systems, they work in simple language and been able to sell this easier by simpler language that it behaves more like a design system as they expect. This all is that. You don&#8217;t have to then build a system on top because then the system will be easily done within, you don&#8217;t then have to bring the system. So I am very excited about this. It is the start. It is something that I would&#8217;ve liked a couple of years ago, but we had so much to do. We&#8217;ll get there. And I think that is the thing of there&#8217;s so much changing to do. Patterns are really getting strong. When they first came out, it felt like, &#8220;Oh, you can do patterns.&#8221; But they are so powerful. People get patterns way more than blocks as well. If you explain a block, people are like, &#8220;You don&#8217;t need to make blocks.&#8221; And I think we&#8217;re going to see less blocks people making and more patterns with this because patterns are just more useful then.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: That&#8217;s what I have been seeing as well is also that people say, &#8220;Okay, I don&#8217;t have to create a custom block just because I want a group of blocks in my site.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: As much as I love block variations, I love all these things that you can do because blocks were amazing. I&#8217;d like to see less because then it means that patterns are doing what they&#8217;re meant to do because that&#8217;s what humans see. The interface that we&#8217;re having for pattern browsing and all that, we&#8217;re getting onto the management stuff that&#8217;s also part of this, that is just better as a human. Those human interfaces, once humans are using that, that&#8217;s way better than the tiny little pickers that we have for blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. But I wanted to go back to what you said, while I would love to have it two years ago, but I think sometimes waiting helps you really to see the big picture, the whole picture. So two years ago, we didn&#8217;t have template parts, yeah?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Or we didn&#8217;t know yet how they&#8217;re going to fit in into the block themes and in pattern, we&#8217;re just at the beginning, but we didn&#8217;t know how to lock them. How to lock certain pieces of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: When I say that, that&#8217;s just eagerness and that&#8217;s also…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yes, impatience. I see it, I want it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: Way too many people in the agency just want it tomorrow because honestly, those are the people who are trying to solve it with design systems who are trying to work around the problem today. Absolutely, these toys are amazing. And that then means these bigger systems can start using. They don&#8217;t have to build on top or around. They can build a lot more natively and the more native you can build, the easier upgrades, the easier components, everything. And it&#8217;s just a better experience for everybody.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Right, right. Or you see the power now and you say, &#8220;Oh, wouldn&#8217;t it be great? And then you have to wait.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: If no one ever has to go through a load of patterns and I&#8217;ve actually had to do this, go through someone makes a change in patterns, but this was quite a while ago. If you use patterns and then you had to make a change in patterns at scale, that was hard to do before. Not having to do that, that&#8217;s going to be amazing. So getting all the amazing benefits of all these things, but having the amazing benefits of things like reusable blocks, but with these visual benefits that humans have. Yeah, it&#8217;s amazing. We have all the toys.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And there&#8217;s one more toy coming, which is now you can get a preview of block themes in your site. We all remember the customizer where you install a theme on your website and then you use the customizer and you were able to preview your site with the theme. And that hasn&#8217;t happened yet, but now it&#8217;s here for block themes as well. You see where you have all your themes, you see a live preview button and that gets you into a similar interface as the site editor. And then you can navigate your site with the theme that is installed but not activated yet. So you can see how your blocks behave, you see how your posts behave, and in advance you don&#8217;t have this what Helen Hou-Sandí always calls the save and pray feature there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: What you see might maybe what you get, but possibly not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Probably different, yes. And it&#8217;s amazing to see this in block themes. You also see all the style variations and how they would change your website and it&#8217;s really amazing. And it&#8217;s in 16.1 and it will come to 6.3 soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister:</em> And moving on to the site editor, the distraction free. We&#8217;ve had distraction free, so it&#8217;s like ta-da. But having that with the site editor, been able to create and just go get away. I remember&#8230; Age, that Dreamweaver full screen mode. And you now got that. The day where you could suddenly do visual in Dreamweaver, we&#8217;ve now got that in WordPress. Wow. It&#8217;s incredible to think that we can do that and you&#8217;ve got that without some of the ickiness. Bless it. Without tables. But we&#8217;ve now got that and that means that you can really focus on what you&#8217;re creating. And sometimes like if you&#8217;re doing some of these three-column query or whatever when you&#8217;re trying to do, you do not need those side panels and everything in the way. So distraction free is really, really nice to be able to do that and create.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We talked earlier about modes when you&#8217;re doing things that really helps you with that creation mode, there&#8217;s a reason why when you are writing, you have those zen modes and that really works for people. Or you have that get away from my desktop all the apps. I don&#8217;t know what you feel, but I think this is just a small improvement to life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Absolutely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: Quality of life improvement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Absolutely. And it&#8217;s a good one, when you can do an almost one-to-one preview of your site for that particular page, it opens up so much or it takes away so much worry. It&#8217;s really a better life there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: Know what you&#8217;re getting rather than guessing what you&#8217;re getting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And test this, please test this so much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: Yeah. And again, that&#8217;s the part of this. A lot of these things, they&#8217;re going in and they&#8217;ve been tested by the people that are creating them and they&#8217;re amazing humans, but they are not the people that are going to be poking it. It&#8217;s now up to people that are listening to this, the people that are going to be testing, who are the people that should be poking it and using it. And I think that is exactly what this is about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Absolutely, absolutely. And what is now coming back to the site editor is editing templates as well as content. At the beginning of when the site editor was introduced, it was already there, but people got confused. Am I editing a page? Or they were not confused. They didn&#8217;t have that concept of a template part like this is just the template that drives all the pages and they made changes, and then were surprised that the changes were duplicated on all the pages. So it was taken out of the editor, and now it comes back with some guidance for the content creator of, &#8220;Okay, you can edit that now and when you&#8217;re in the template, you get all this whole title kind of thing.&#8221; It names the things that are in there. And when you&#8217;re on a page, it gives you the page title exactly how you put it in and then you can edit it. But when you go into the places where the template is, it tells you this is a template piece, do you want to edit now? And then gets you out of the editing mode into a template editing mode.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think that the guardrails there really help with the mental image as well. This is a template, I don&#8217;t want to screw that up. I just want this on my page. I want that content done. And you can do it in the site editor. Do you have to go back to the WP admin? Once in a while when you create pages, yes, yeah. But sometimes you want to edit things and you want to see it with&#8230; that&#8217;s the good part in this section now when you have the edit the page content as well as the template, is you see the page and it&#8217;s all in its context. How will it show up on the site? There is no, &#8220;Oh, okay. There is something on the sidebar that&#8217;s interfering with my page.&#8221; And it&#8217;s the same thing that we talked about before where as long as you see the full context of your page, all the worry goes away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister:</em> I love what you said as well about having something in and then taking it away. I think that&#8217;s really, really important because sometimes when something&#8217;s completely new, it doesn&#8217;t work because it&#8217;s new, it&#8217;s not because it&#8217;s a bad idea and this is showing, it just needed to be delivered in a certain way. And I think not everything, but quite a few things that have been added a little bit recently are that. They are re-adding a slightly different variation once we&#8217;ve got things together. So sometimes you&#8217;ve got to find the combination of the puzzle to put these pieces in or the order to put them in. And this is exactly one of those, it needed to come in a certain order.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And I had some interesting conversations at WordCamp Europe. I had a lot of conversations at WordCamp Europe, but some of them were really interesting because I think if you&#8217;re not a developer, it&#8217;s really hard to understand that you have a vision for what people want to do. But unless you start programming and putting it in, you don&#8217;t know yet how it&#8217;s going, how it&#8217;s going to work. So let&#8217;s put it with the features in and then see what other people think about it and then reiterate on it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: It&#8217;s part of the freedom of creating in the open and part of what we&#8217;ve learned with this whole project is by creating in a plugin, we get to experiment. I want to use the word play because experiment sometimes feels a little bit harsh, it feels serious, but we get to play and see if this goes here, what did someone feel about it? This goes here. Testing things was really, really hard to do in core and it has been really, really hard. But by having it in this and been able to backtrack quicker, and that has been something that has happened time and time again of, &#8220;Oops, nope, let&#8217;s try this.&#8221; Or, &#8220;Okay, well this idea didn&#8217;t work this time.&#8221; We&#8217;ve still got it in the code base. It&#8217;s just back now. We haven&#8217;t completely lost it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In core, ideas go and get lost because it&#8217;s a big space, sadly. So having that flexibility, I think we are doing it a lot more as a project and having that healthier macro experimentation. But it&#8217;s seeing those mature ideas come. I love seeing things that was talked about, like you said footnotes, but things that were said years and years ago and it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Yay, they finally shipped.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And it&#8217;s not because they couldn&#8217;t ship it earlier. It&#8217;s also you didn&#8217;t know yet how other pieces that needed to fit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: It&#8217;s like baking a cake. It needs to be the right time and the right ingredients need to be available, and the right people to taste the cake. I don&#8217;t know, that metaphor went really weird, but right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Well, only chocolate lovers love chocolate cake, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: Yeah. And sometimes you are not delivering chocolate cake, you are delivering a Victorian sponge and to the wrong crowd. I don&#8217;t know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Those metaphors are really…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: It&#8217;s not working. Backtrack, what&#8217;s the next thing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Let&#8217;s try it again. We all have experiences, but it&#8217;s not in WordPress. So creating something really, really new in WordPress with a lot of backwards compatibility promises, it&#8217;s really hard.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: I always describe it as the difference between moving a little rowing boat to moving an ocean liner. One of them big Disney cruises or these giant things and then moving a little rowing boat. It is really easy, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: It&#8217;s not the same.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, yeah. But this editing piece, I think it&#8217;s really so much better now and I think it meets the vision now. So what&#8217;s also in the site editor bar is some template details. You might have already seen that, but now it also respects the settings and there is some language going on as well. Some language changes. You see the home template details, but that only tells you, okay, how many blog posts are on it? So it&#8217;s the blog home and not only just the homepage. So if you switch it to a static page, you will see that in the pages and not in the template pages. But it&#8217;s really good to have those template details in the site editor on the sidebar, it gives you a little bit more context.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: With components, I guess one of them to call out is the button has a size prop, which is a small little thing, but it&#8217;s maturity of the burn block, how many sites have burned every one of them? And having something like that is really big. It&#8217;s going back to one of my favorite topics of design systems. If we are building off core as a basis, you need to have these foundational things as part of it. So I&#8217;m really excited to see. Anytime I see that or any of the blocks getting different attributes, I am giddy with excitement about all those things. Basically because it means I can then use them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: You can use them, you can create styles with them. You can have different variations on the buttons and you don&#8217;t have to create a new block for the buttons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister:</em> Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Another block that got some nice features, an additional feature in there is the list block. It now has a different numbering type for the ordered list. So you could have alphabetical numbering or numbered numbering or Roman lit numbering and then capitals and then small cases. So now you have quite some options in there. I really like that. It&#8217;s catching up with other documentation or writing tools where you have that. But yeah, it&#8217;s good to have it in there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: And image block has as aspect ratio control. For some reason, I wanted to say radio control. That was exciting. I think that&#8217;s a whole different thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Multimedia, an image has radio.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: Which again is maturity, right? You mentioned parity with tools. It is, right? We need to have the best of these tools so that people use them natively. So that&#8217;s really what a lot of this is maturity of these tools, I think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And that was particularly important because you want your patterns when you switch out the images, you have them in a certain aspect ratio and when you switch them out and somebody puts in another image, you want it in the same aspect ratio and not blow up the whole pattern.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: Could ruin a party, that really can.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. I&#8217;m scrolling past it, but there is just stop to say that the interactivity API will not be in 6.3. It has been merged for the Gutenberg plugin, but it will only be available&#8230; they&#8217;re aiming for 6.4, which is not so far away, actually. September is the next beta. So it&#8217;s really going forward. There were some questions in the community about the interactivity API. A lot of people are very excited about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: We&#8217;re going to have some really nice toys for Christmas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And November 8th is I think the release of 6.4. So let&#8217;s get those toys wrapped up for Christmas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: That&#8217;s actually going to be some really interesting testing, I think. Some difference in testing because yes, we&#8217;ve done, but how you test some of that stuff is going to be a little bit different, I think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And we need a lot more examples.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: That&#8217;s where I&#8217;m going. How do you push some of that stuff?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And definitely there&#8217;s some documentation. I think they started with the documentation now. There were quite a few insights already in the make blog on core. I think two of them, and I can certainly add them to the show notes. So people who are all interested in that and want to help with the rollout, definitely can get a headstart on it, but not in 6.3.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: The next one, I&#8217;m going past so much, this is such a long list. It&#8217;s amazing. It is in the design tool section and that&#8217;s a sticky position. That&#8217;s not a phrase. Try re-enabling non-root sticky position. So actually, I think any improvements to things like this is really nice. The fact that we have this shows maturity of design tools. So I think that&#8217;s part of calling this out. Design tools as a whole are a concept that is still relatively new to us, but design tools means again, that people are going to build using it. And so I&#8217;m really excited anytime that any of our refinement happens to any of our design tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And I think in 6.2, the sticky position was already introduced for the header and the footer, but it was not for the sidebar because somehow it was really, really hard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: Sticky is hard. Sticky is hard to stick.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: You never get it to stick. And it needed to be a root wrapper or root block to make it sticky. You couldn&#8217;t do it in a column block where you have a sidebar and make that sticky.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: Because CSS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Because of CSS, yes. Yeah. So there is another attempt to make this work and needs definitely testing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister:</em> Yes, I was about to say that if anything needs testing, any time you see something listed in design tools, I would point anyone who is building themes or building anything to please test around those things because these are what really you will be building with. Having native sticky positions is much better than having to call on libraries or add things. And again, it means that people who want to build and create in the editor themselves have that capability to create some incredible, powerful, beautiful designs without having lack of access to them. It all sets us up to what amazing things could be done with the default themes, and that&#8217;s super exciting, what Christmas is going to bring there with all these tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So the next one is actually for media and we need to set this up a bit. So when you copy paste something from Google or from another website and there&#8217;s images in there, when you paste them into your canvas, the image will always go back to the original. So when the original site goes away, especially when you migrate from one domain to the other, the image goes away. And now there was a little button on every image where you could say and if it was allowed from the source site, that you could add that image to your library with a button. But of course when you have 15 images, it&#8217;s a little harder to do that. So now in the pre-publish screen, there is a section that suggests that you upload the external images and gives you a button and you can do it all at once. You also can click on the images and see how they show up in the post or in the page. So I think that&#8217;s a great addition to…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: Just what people expect. Again, and I do not belittle it by saying that. It&#8217;s more just, it just raises it up. It&#8217;s what people expect, it&#8217;s what people want. So it&#8217;s amazing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: It really raises the quality of the tools that you use, that it actually helps you also with the little things. Images are important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: Quality of life. Really, the release is quality of life and completion, which is a beautiful summer thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And refinement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: Yeah. So I think we&#8217;re going to talk maybe a little bit later about the command section, but we&#8217;re into commands.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: We&#8217;re good?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: Going down the list, there&#8217;s two things about the commands and that is add commands to templates, template parts and styles, and to related commands as well. I don&#8217;t know if you want to talk about commands right now or later?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit Pauli-Haack: We could. So we have a name now for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: We do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: In the development, it was always called the command center, but now it&#8217;s command palette and it tries to convey that&#8217;s the tool when you hit control K in the site editor, it gives you quick access to various commands, context-sensitive. And so you can say go to library or go to templates or go to template parts or delete template parts. All this you can do, and it&#8217;s also extensible. So you can create commands for your plugins, you can create commands for your themes as well. But the API is very, very new. So there are commands and with this release, there are commands with template, template parts, styles, how to manage the custom patterns, which custom patterns are the former reusable blocks. Sync patterns. So now you can say to your command palette, manage patterns or you also get UI commands for your post editor. So where you can say, add new post or something like that. So it&#8217;s not the center of it because it&#8217;s not a mission control palette or something like that. Or dashboard, it&#8217;s just you have a thought that you wanted…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: It&#8217;s your friendly helper there and there. And I think what these are doing is giving you examples. As you said, this is the start and it&#8217;s new. So by having these there, and this is just to start again, I think it&#8217;s worth of saying these are an example that someone could look at and be like, &#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s how you write one,&#8221; as well. So I am super curious to do that myself and be like, &#8220;Oh, okay, that&#8217;s how you write one. Okay.&#8221; And I am really excited to see what people create with this. Now we have decided the name, I was going to call it Bob, but it didn&#8217;t catch on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I always call him Fred.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: I call everyone Bob. No idea. Everyone picks a name that they call things repetitively, I think. And now that it has a name, which is amazing. And I think one of the good things is its translatable. And I think that was key in all of it. Personally, as long as it&#8217;s translatable, as long as we agree to something, we get it in, things can change. But let&#8217;s get it in and iterate. So these are great examples to then copy, rehash, and learn from. So I think 6.4, we&#8217;ll probably see more. And then I imagine there&#8217;s going to be a flowy of plugins, some nice little iterations and people exploring what it means to have these things as well. So it&#8217;s going to be very exciting to see what people create.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, I&#8217;m really happy about that. I would&#8217;ve never thought that my website tool would have these quick commands that I can just call up and then do stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: So the way that I think of it is a combination of&#8230; Because initially, I was Alfred was where my mind went because it&#8217;s searchy, I think of it now like Alfred. And if this, then that, and those two things combined is where I go because it is that, but it&#8217;s also workflow. So it&#8217;s that but in WordPress for me, and I am very excited about extending that and then where people take it, because people always take it in a way that you would never expect it to go. So I think the next year or so, we&#8217;re going to see some really exciting things come from that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, I totally agree with that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: New toys.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: New toys for everybody when the biggest toy is probably creating those commands and find, &#8220;Yeah, oh I can do this. It&#8217;s not that hard.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: And then even vigilant spaces to be able to create those commands ourselves. That becoming easier and easier I think is something that will happen over time as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, I totally get it. I want to get into programming so much and lock myself away for two weeks and do all this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: You don&#8217;t have to lock yourself away for it, but that&#8217;s all right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. So I&#8217;m scrolling and scrolling and scrolling. I don&#8217;t see anything anymore.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: So much. And I think that&#8217;s the thing. If we are going through the bug fixes and the enhancements and there&#8217;s just so much, I like the repetitive word flaky because when I see the fix flaky, that means that all the things which flaky is a bug report for, it kind of works and it kind of didn&#8217;t. I love that we&#8217;re down to that end of polishing, is my reflection on that. So I think that is really, really exciting that there&#8217;s so much polishing here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, and I think that was actually the outlook for 6.3, that most of the features get in and then we&#8217;re almost already…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: This is a giant section of those, which I love.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Are we done? I think we&#8217;re done. Oh yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: There are a lot of documentation fixes. Code quality fixes, code quality in block library, code quality in site editor. No, this is cool. Yes. Tooling. Yeah, the whole testing thing was kind of, whoa.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: That&#8217;s what you were talking about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: And I think that&#8217;s the thing that&#8217;s there. It&#8217;s probably testing coming in for command as well, but it&#8217;s all maturity of that. As I&#8217;m scrolling down, I&#8217;m seeing improving, improving, improving, improving.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. No, I think we made it. Yay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: Yay.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>WordPress 6.3 Beta</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. So we want to bring it back to the WordPress 6.3 beta and talk a little bit about what this means plus tickets for 6.3.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: I think one of the big things to think about is yes, there are things in now, but things that are in are going to have to respond to feedback. So whilst you might think, &#8220;Oh, that burden is perfectly placed,&#8221; I am really paraphrasing here, &#8220;That burden might not be perfectly placed.&#8221; So during beaters, you might see that burden moves because that burden needs to be in a better place. And there are a couple of tickets out there at the moment, which one of them particularly has things could be done in a better way. That&#8217;s where I&#8217;m going with this. So we are going to see that. We are going to see, &#8220;Oh dear, this breaks this under this circumstance when we actually tested it under this load or we tested it under this situation.&#8221; Because you can test under all the situations you think, but you don&#8217;t have that until you are real world testing or you&#8217;re testing. And as the betas get towards the higher numbers, we&#8217;re on two now. So we&#8217;re probably going to go at least four I would say, I don&#8217;t know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> I agree, I agree.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: I want to be optimistic. But realism kicks in here a little bit. You&#8217;re going to see fixes. So people need to bug report. People need to test or poke it, prod it, and use it. If you find something, see something, report something is the biggest thing because if you see something at release candidate, it&#8217;s a little bit late. It&#8217;s like shouting after the sheep have left the field. But if you say something now, it can be fixed. So if something doesn&#8217;t work with the plugin that is the only reason your client&#8217;s site works, now&#8217;s the reason to say basically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, definitely. And there will be. So I also wanted to caution some of the more eager WordPress news people or that want to grab screenshots and that kind of thing. There might be changes there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: Going back to my button moving.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: For instance, one change is from 6.0 to beta or to 16.2, so plugin releases 6.0 to 6.2, which will probably have some of the things that will get into 6.3 WordPress. But there was one menu item in the site editor on the bottom that was called library. And that has been renamed to patterns because that&#8217;s what&#8217;s in there. It&#8217;s the reusable block that are patterns now, template parts that are patterns now, and your custom patterns that are patterns now. And one was thinking about the library part for a long time because also there will be a fonts library, something like that. But then there were quite a few smart people who said, &#8220;Well, if I&#8217;m looking for fonts, I won&#8217;t go to library. I go to my styles and that&#8217;s a separate place.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So while we were using it, it was rethought what would make it a better idea or better metaphor for that. And pattern is something that&#8217;s WordPress branded and that a lot of people are really responding to. So library was not, it removes cognitive load when you have to think about, &#8220;I need to think of library.&#8221; When you see patterns, that&#8217;s where you want to go. So that&#8217;s just one example. There might be others. So when you do a screenshot for your video, make sure you have the latest beta or the latest…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: Really, screenshots is release candidate as much as it feels late, it&#8217;s not. There&#8217;s several weeks and that&#8217;s when you&#8217;ll find a lot of documentation takes it as well. I&#8217;ll working on the about page and we&#8217;re going to be doing the graphics around there as much as possible. But honestly, the final-final 01 PSD graphics&#8230; I don&#8217;t have to deal with PSDs, that&#8217;s when you take them because things rightly about translation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This language though, I think so many of these language refinements happening, whether you agree with it or not, because language is so subjective and everyone has feelings about Bob or Fred, what things should be called, is a sign of maturity of the product, is that we&#8217;re working our own language system and we&#8217;re saying these things are called this because it makes sense in our ecosystem. So I welcome that we&#8217;re finally clarifying some language and not just confusing everybody because it&#8217;s always been very confusing. We&#8217;re finally settling on some terms and we are then documenting what they are called because one of the problems we&#8217;ve always done is called something and then not written it down. So actually doing that is really helpful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Release candidate is scheduled for the 27th of July, so it&#8217;s another four weeks to go. So caution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: So you got to let the dust settle, you got to let stuff go. If everything is amazing and unicorns walk and everything, then nothing will change, but something&#8217;s going to change because humans in software.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, it&#8217;s going to change. And computers, right? Computers are involved, all bets are off, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: Yeah. And that&#8217;s okay, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: That&#8217;s totally okay. Just if you&#8217;re going on holiday, maybe have a friend do your screenshot for your blog post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: All right. So before we all come to an end, just a reminder, the two live Q&amp;As on July 6th and July 21st. Hit the registration button so we can all see you also on the live show and with some great demos. Before we end this show, do you have anything that you want to&#8230; How can people get in touch with you, Tammie?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: I&#8217;m karma Toast on all the things and I&#8217;m still around core, I&#8217;m around everywhere and I would love to speak to people. I will be at WordCamp U.S. as well if someone else is going. So I&#8217;d love to say hi, but reaching out, I&#8217;m always welcome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Awesome, awesome. Thank you so much for being on the show. And as always, dear listeners, the show notes will be published on gutenbergtimes.com/podcast. This is episode 85, and if you have questions or suggestions or news you want us to cover, send them to <a href=\"mailto:changelog@gutenbergtimes.com\">changelog@gutenbergtimes.com</a>.

Mika Epstein, who has served for the past decade, is stepping down, but not before<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2023/06/29/plugin-review-team-update-the-next-phase-begins/\"> launching a new crew of volunteers</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team is responsible for approving newly submitted plugins, maintaining the Plugin Reviewer Handbook, as well as investigating any reported security issues and guideline violations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Historically, the Plugin Review team has had very little turnover, but a new crop of six sponsored volunteers will be contributing an estimated 50+ hours per week. The new members include <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/davidperez/\">David Pérez</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/eherman24/\">Evan Herman</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/frantorres/\">Francisco Torres</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/lukecarbis/\">Luke Carbis</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/martatorre/\">Marta Torre</a>, and <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/pacomarchante/\">Paco Marchante</a>. Their efforts are already in demand as they work to tackle a large backlog of plugins. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Given the nature of the work the team does, joining this team is a little different than some of the others: each new member will go through a vetting process by current team members before being selected,&#8221; Epstein said. &#8220;Some of the things the team is looking for are: a solid track record as a plugin developer; the ability to communicate clearly, kindly and constructively – both with other developers and users; interest in improving tools and processes; and excellent collaborative and conflict-management skills.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Epstein is encouraging more volunteers to apply, if they have at least five hours per week to devote to the team, as they could still use more help. Prospective team members can <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/handbook/apply/\">submit an application</a>, which will be evaluated by current team members. Applicants will be required to send examples of plugins they have coded to demonstrate their experience, provide references, and detail some of their contributions to the project.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 01 Jul 2023 02:52:15 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:105:\"Post Status: WordPress 6.3 Beta 2 • Help Test • WPDiversity • Plugin Team Next Phase • Mentorship\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=149753\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:100:\"https://poststatus.com/wordpress-6-3-beta-2-help-test-wpdiversity-plugin-team-next-phase-mentorship/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:21961:\"<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-this-week-at-wordpress-org-april-3-2023\">This Week at WordPress.org (June 26, 2023)</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"has-background has-theme-palette-8-background-color wp-block-post-excerpt\"><p class=\"wp-block-post-excerpt__excerpt\">Release season is upon us as we approach WordPress 6.3&#8217;s August 8th release.

Now as a project manager and social media content manager living in North Carolina, USA, she uses the software in her work and  in disability-advocacy.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The&nbsp;<em>People of WordPress</em>&nbsp;series shares inspiring stories of how people’s lives can change for the better through WordPress and its global community of contributors.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1024\" height=\"537\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/06/fi-allison-dye.jpg?resize=1024%2C537&ssl=1\" alt=\"Allison Dye\" class=\"wp-image-15292\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Allison was first introduced to WordPress when she was 13 years old. Her parents gave her own WordPress website to use, play, test, and try whatever she wanted with it. Her health issues had started when she was eight years old, and being able to express who she was and learn new skills provided an escape she needed. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">My first encounter with WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Allison said: &#8220;While the technical aspects of my new WordPress website intrigued me, I was more interested in the space it made for me to write. All throughout my childhood I had struggled with chronic pain, fatigue, and other unexplained symptoms. Having a private world I could call my own, I was able to write my story.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>&#8220;There is something truly amazing about having a place to tell your story.&#8221;</p>\n<cite>Allison Dye</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Her family faced many doctors, nurse, specialists and hospital visits, but could not get an answer to the difficulties faced by Allison. She said: &#8220;I felt like my life and world were out of control. But logging onto my little website and typing away on the computer keys gave me a sense of control. I couldn’t always do things that other kids had the energy to do. But I could get lost in writing for hours. I couldn’t control my life story, but I could write about it.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She felt it was like writing letters to her future self and would act as a reminder of how strong she had become. Even now when Allison writes on her website, she feels it is writing letters to her past self, expressing reassurance and pride. The practice of writing online continues to help her reflect on how she coped and made it through the difficulties.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">WordPress in the real world</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Allison hoped her early experiences with hospitals and being unwell was just part of being a child, and that in adulthood she would be healthy. She longed for this time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Growing up did not bring her this dream of a healthier life and an end to chronic pain. In fact, her condition worsened as she went through her teens and at 18 she finally received a diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/06/allison-2.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&ssl=1\" alt=\"Allison stood in front of trees\" class=\"wp-image-15290\" />Allison enjoying time with nature and trees\n\n\n\n<p>This changed what had been conventional job choices, as she was not able to handle a 9 to 5 work schedule. She could not drive herself to work on some days and relied on her mother to help with transport. She knew that she would have to find another way to work and she was determined to find it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She began writing music and book reviews online, and then moved onto writing blog posts. As they were published she started to receive payment and a sense of power over her life. She said: &#8220;WordPress felt familiar, typing on the computer keys felt comfortable, and sharing my words with the world felt surreal.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Allison&#8217;s sense of ownership of the software became part of her strength. &#8220;I think I believed WordPress was mine somehow. I was learning that WordPress is something that belongs to everyone in some way. And I loved it.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Finding work with WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The confidence using the platform gave Allison led her to find more about what it could do and meet other people who used it. She said: &#8220;The thing I love about WordPress is that it’s not just for developers or bloggers or SEO experts. I began to meet more people in the community and was delighted to find people like me, who didn’t know the technical stuff, but were a part of WordPress.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This global community orbiting around the software gave her an opportunity to meet social media managers, designers, and people from many different areas. She found that &#8216;there was a place for everyone&#8217;. The guiding strength and fascination Allison found and still finds today is in that community. Allison said: &#8220;The community felt as important as the rest of everything that makes WordPress what it is. It felt like it was about people and relationships as well as codes and databases.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2020, she was hired by a WordPress company. She said: &#8220;I like being a part of a WordPress company, and I love that I contribute to a team that helps people with their websites. I understand the importance of having a space that’s yours. Whether it’s a business or personal site, having a website gives you the power of telling your own story.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress gave Allison a freedom and an independence. She did not have to work a 9 to 5 job, rely on others to drive her on bad days with her MS, nor worry about days when she wanted to stay in her sweatshirts rather than go into an office to work. She said: &#8220;I have a 100% remote job which I can do despite the plot twists in my story, thanks to WordPress and the people in it.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress took Allison into the world of project management for a small agency, and this experience was to help guide her path, skills and confidence into the future. She went on to work in content management in WordPress, building pages for awareness campaigns for non profit organizations and small businesses as a contractor. She helps people update their websites, add and edit content, perform basic updates and help them to learn how to use their sites. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>&#8220;I tell all my clients to use WordPress because there is really no other solution that can scale as easily for growing organizations and small businesses. I love how WordPress allows them to tell their stories, share their passion, and have a place to call their own on the internet.&#8221;</p>\n<cite>Allison Dye</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>As a fluent English and Italian speaker, Allison is able to support clients in different countries from where she lives. &#8220;I love that with WordPress I&#8217;m able to support clients remotely. This is thanks to all of the many WordPress contributors, developers, project managers, content writers, and many, many volunteers that work tirelessly to enable people around the world to use WordPress.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Allison also became a certified as an English As A Second Language (ESL) teacher. &#8220;My affinity for words and languages allows me to teach passionately and creatively. I’m Italian-American and am fluent in English and Italian. Teaching English allows me to share my passion for communication with others.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Welcomed into the WordPress community</h2>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1024\" height=\"562\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/06/WPCoffeeTalk-Allie-Dye.png?resize=1024%2C562&ssl=1\" alt=\"Allie interviewed for a podcast on her use of WordPress\" class=\"wp-image-15293\" />Allie interviewed for a podcast on her use of WordPress\n\n\n\n<p>Allison attributes mentors and supporters in the WordPress community for helping her appreciate she really is part of it. Allison recalled: &#8220;It felt unreal. I wasn’t a dev, I don’t know how to code, and yet I got to be a part of it all? I felt like I was a fake. But Kimberly continues to remind me that I’m real, I get to be here, I get to stay, I have a place.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She was later encouraged to contribute by a WordPress community member to the Big Orange Heart, which aims to support and promote positive well-being and mental health within remote working communities. She said she felt &#8216;honored typing my words, pieces of my story, and sharing them with a community of people&#8217;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She also joined the <a href=\"https://us.wordcamp.org/2021/\">WordCamp US 2021</a> online organizing team. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Allison enjoys the fact that in the WordPress community, &#8216;everyone here is constantly working to be better and do better&#8217;.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Facing the future with strength from her friends and colleagues in WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"675\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/06/allison-1.jpg?resize=675%2C900&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-15289\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Allison was later diagnosed with two additional neurological conditions: Functional Neurological Disorder and Migraine. She said: &#8220;If it were not for WordPress I would really be unable to work. But WordPress and its community continue to be a part of my life and I am grateful to everyone who&#8217;s helped me along my way. I don&#8217;t know where I would even be without it.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She strives to raise awareness of dynamic disabilities and invisible illnesses like her own through podcasts and social media. She feels that her WordPress friends have helped her both in her professional life and in her wish to be an advocate for others with disabilities too.<br /><br />Allison hopes reading of her experience will help others who are worried about not progressing in a WordPress career due to health concerns.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>&#8220;I hope that it will remind anyone reading this that WordPress is a space for everyone. Healthy or not, developer or not, blogger or not — WordPress belongs to you too.&#8221;</p>\n<cite>Allison Dye</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Share the stories</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Help share these stories of open source contributors and continue to grow the community.&nbsp;Meet more WordPressers in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/category/newsletter/interviews/\">People of WordPress series</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Contributors</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to Allie Dye (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/allisondye/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>allisondye</a>)&nbsp;for sharing about her adventures in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Props to Abha Thakor (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/webcommsat/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>webcommsat</a>) and the late Surendra Thakor (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/sthakor/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>sthakor</a>) for interviews and writing the feature, Meher Bala (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/meher/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>meher</a>) for work on images, and to Meher, Maja Loncan (@mloncar) and Chloe Bringmann (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/cbringmann/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>cbringmann</a>) for reviews.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The&nbsp;<em>People of WordPress</em>&nbsp;series thanks Josepha Haden (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/chanthaboune/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>chanthaboune</a>) and Topher DeRosia (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/topher1kenobe/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>topher1kenobe</a>) for their support.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile is-vertically-aligned-center\"><img width=\"180\" height=\"135\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/03/heropress_logo_180.png?resize=180%2C135&ssl=1\" alt=\"HeroPress logo\" class=\"wp-image-8409 size-full\" /><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\"><em>This People of WordPress feature is inspired by an essay originally published on </em><a href=\"https://heropress.com/\"><em>HeroPress.com</em></a><em>, a community initiative created by Topher DeRosia.

No coding skills required!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the whole event, there will also be ample time for networking and meeting other WordPress enthusiasts. Getting to meet and learn from other WordPress users face-to-face is one of the main reasons people attend WordCamps. In addition to learning from each other, attendees often make new friends and find employees/employers from the WordCamp crowd.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://finland.wordcamp.org/2023/tickets/\">Secure your tickets</a> now and ensure you’ll get to experience all of the insightful talks and activities with a welcoming community!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The full list of speakers, session descriptions and schedule will be published in early August, so make sure to follow us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wordcampfinland\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/WordCampFinland\">Facebook</a> and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/wordcamp-finland\">Linkedin</a> to get the latest updates.

My name is Nathan Wrigley. Jukebox is a podcast, which is dedicated to all things WordPress. The people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case how AI and WordPress can work together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for. WP Tavern in your podcast player of choice. Or by going to WPTavern.com forward slash feed forward slash podcast. And you can copy that URL into most podcast players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature on the podcast, I&#8217;m keen to hear from you. And hopefully get you or your idea featured on the show. Head to WPTavern.com forward slash contact forward slash jukebox, and use the form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today, we have James Dominy. James is a computer scientist with a master&#8217;s degree in bioinformatics. He lives in Ireland working at the WP engine Limerick office.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the second podcast recorded at WordCamp Europe, 2023 in Athens. James gave a talk at the event about the influence of AI on the WordPress community and how it&#8217;s going to disrupt so many of the roles which WordPressers currently occupy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We talk about the recent rise of ChatGPT, and the fact that it&#8217;s made AI available to almost anyone. In less than 12 months, many of us have gone from never touching AI technologies to using them on a daily basis to speed up some aspect of our work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The discussion moves on to the rate at which AI systems might evolve, and whether or not they&#8217;re truly intelligent or just a suite of technologies which masquerade is intelligent. Are they merely good at predicting the next word or phrase in any given sentence? Is there a scenario in which we can expect our machines to stop simply regurgitating texts and images based upon what they&#8217;ve consumed; a future in which they can set their own agendas and learn based upon their own goals?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This gets into the subject of whether or not AI is in any meaningful way innately intelligent, or just good at making us think that it is, and whether or not the famous Turing test is a worthwhile measure of the abilities of an AI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>James&#8217; his background in biochemistry comes in handy as we turn our attention to whether or not there&#8217;s something unique about the brains that we all possess. Or if intelligence is merely a matter of the amount of compute power that an AI can consume. It&#8217;s more or less certain that given time machines will be more capable than they are now. So when if ever does the intelligence Rubicon get crossed?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The current AI systems can be broadly classified as Large Language Models or LLMs for short, and James explains what these are and how they work. How can they create a sentence word by word if they don&#8217;t have an understanding of where each sentence is going to end up?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>James explains that LLMs are a little more complex than just handling one word at a time, always moving backwards and forwards within their predictions to ensure that they&#8217;re creating content which makes sense, even if it&#8217;s not always factually accurate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We then move on from the conceptual understanding of AI to more concrete ways it can be implemented. What ways can WordPress users implement AI right now? And what innovations might we reasonably expect to be available in the future? Will we be able to get AI to make intelligent decisions about our websites SEO or design, and therefore be able to focus our time on other more pressing matters?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a fascinating conversation, whether or not you&#8217;ve used AI tools in the past.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more, you can find all the links in the show notes by heading to WPTavern.com forward slash podcast. Where you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so without further delay, I bring you James Dominy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast today by James Dominy. How are you doing James?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:51] <strong>James Dominy:</strong> I&#8217;m well, thanks. Hi Nathan. How are you doing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:53] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, good, thanks. We&#8217;re at WordCamp Europe. We&#8217;re upstairs somewhere. I&#8217;m not entirely sure where we are in all honesty. The principle idea of today&#8217;s conversation with James is he&#8217;s done a presentation at WordCamp Europe all about AI. Now, I literally can&#8217;t think of a topic which is getting more interest at the moment. It seems the general press is talking about AI all the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:17] <strong>James Dominy:</strong> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:17] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It&#8217;s consuming absolutely everything. So it&#8217;s the perfect time to have this conversation. What was your talk about today? What did you actually talk about in front of those people?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:24] <strong>James Dominy:</strong> Right. So my talk was about the influence of AI on the WordPress community. The WordPress community involving, in my mind, roughly three groups. You&#8217;ve got your freelancer, single content generator, blogger. You have someone who does the same job but in a business as in an agency or a marketing or a brand context. And then on the other side, you&#8217;ve got software developers who are developing plugins or working on the actual WordPress Core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And AI is going to be changing the way all of those people work. Mostly I focused on the first and the third groups. I don&#8217;t know enough about the business aspects to really talk about the agency and the marketing side of things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I personally, I&#8217;m a software developer, so I suppose I really skewed towards that in the end. But, my wife has been a WordPresser for 15, 20 years, which is how I ended up doing this. And a lot of the things that she&#8217;s been using ChatGPT quite actively recently.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And she&#8217;s been chatting to me after work going, you know, I was trying to use ChatGPT to do X Y Z. And I thought, well, you know, that&#8217;s interesting. I know some bit about machine learning and the way these things work. I&#8217;ve read some stuff on the internals and I have opinions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:33] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Perfect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:34] <strong>James Dominy:</strong> So that&#8217;s how I got here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:35] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. Well, that&#8217;s perfect. Thank you. It seems like at the moment the word ChatGPT could be easily interchanged with AI . Everybody is using that as the pseudonym for AI and it&#8217;s not really, is it? It really is a much bigger subject. But that is, it feels at the moment, the most useful implementation in the WordPress space. You know, you lock it into the block editor in some way shape and you create some content in that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:00] <strong>James Dominy:</strong> And I mean, I am absolutely guilty of that. I think the number of times I&#8217;ve said ChatGPT, I mean AI generative systems, or something during my workshop this morning is well beyond count.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>it is likely to fall victim of a trademark thing at some point. Like Google desperately tries to claim that Google is a trademark and shouldn&#8217;t be used as a generic term for search. I expect the same thing will happen with ChatGPT at some point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:25] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> This is going to sound a little bit, well, maybe snarky is the wrong word, but I hope you don&#8217;t take it this way, but it feels to me that the pace of change in AI is so remarkably rapid. I mean, like nothing I can think of. So, is there a way that we can even know what AI could look like in a year&#8217;s time, two years&#8217; time, five years&#8217; time? So in other words, if we speculate on what it could be to WordPress, is that a serious enterprise? Is it serious endeavor? Or are we just hoping that we get the right guess? Because I don&#8217;t know what it&#8217;s going to be like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:59] <strong>James Dominy:</strong> I think if we rephrase the question a bit, we might get a better answer. So AIs are human design systems. And there is a thing called the alignment problem where there is an element of design to AIs, and we give it a direction, but it doesn&#8217;t always go the direction we want and I think that is the unanswerable part of this question.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, there are going to be emergent surprises from the capabilities of AIs. But for the most part, AIs are developed with a specific goal in mind. Large language models were developed, okay I&#8217;m taking a wild educated guess here perhaps, but they were developed with the idea of producing text that sounded like a human. And I mean, we&#8217;ve had the Turing test for nearly a hundred years, more than a hundred years? 21, yeah, more than a hundred years now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I mean, that&#8217;s been a goal for a hundred years. Everyone says that AI has advanced rapidly and it has, but the core mathematical principles that are involved, those haven&#8217;t advanced. I don&#8217;t want to take away from the people who&#8217;ve done the work here. There has been work that&#8217;s been put into it, but I think what&#8217;s really given us the quantum leap here is the amount of computational power that we can throw at the problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as long as that is increasing exponentially, I think we can expect that the models themselves will get exponentially better at roughly the same rate as the amount of hardware we throw at it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:28] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So we can stare into the future and imagine that it&#8217;s going to get exponentially, logarithmically it&#8217;s going to, it&#8217;s just going to get better and better and better. But we can&#8217;t predict the ways that it might output that betterness. Who knows what kind of interface there&#8217;ll be, or.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:41] <strong>James Dominy:</strong> Yeah. I think better&#8217;s a very evasive term perhaps, on my part. I think there are specific ways that it is going to get better. For example, we are going to see less confused AIs, because they are able to process more tokens. They have deeper models. Deeper statistical trees for outputs. They&#8217;re able to take more context in and apply it to whatever comes out. So in that sense we&#8217;re going to see a better output from an AI. Is it going to ever be able to innovate? Ooh, that&#8217;s a deep philosophical question, and I mean we can get into that, but I don&#8217;t know that we have time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:20] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I think I would like to get into that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:22] <strong>James Dominy:</strong> Okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:22] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Because when we begin talking about AI, I think the word which sticks is intelligence. The artificial bit gets quickly forgotten and we imagine that there is some kind of intelligence behind this, because we ask it a fairly straightforward, or even indeed quite complicated question.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we get something which appears to pass the Turing test. Just for those people who are listening, the Turing test is a fairly blunt measure of whether you are talking to something which is a human or not human, masquerading as a human. And if something is deemed to have passed the Turing test, it&#8217;s indistinguishable from a human.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, I have an intuition that really what we&#8217;re getting back, it&#8217;s not intelligent in any meaningful sense of the word. It&#8217;s kind of like a regurgitation machine. It&#8217;s sucking in information and then it&#8217;s just giving us a best approximation of what it thinks we want to hear. But it&#8217;s not truly intelligent. If you asked it something utterly tangential, that it had no capacity, it had no data storage on, it would be unable to cope with that, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:22] <strong>James Dominy:</strong> I think yes. If you can clearly delineate the idea of, we have no data on this, which is very difficult considering the amounts of information that, you know, give something access to Wikipedia and that AI generative system might well be able to produce an opinion on practically anything these days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if it hasn&#8217;t read the latest paper on advanced quantum mechanic theory, it&#8217;s not going to know it. That text isn&#8217;t going to be there. Could it reproduce that paper? That&#8217;s a subtely different question, because then it comes down to, well, when a human produces that paper, what are they really doing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They&#8217;re synthesizing their knowledge from a bunch of different things that they&#8217;ve learned, and they&#8217;re producing text in a language, in a grammar, that they have learned in a very similar way, that statistically speaking this sentence follows this grammatical form. Because I have learned that as a child through hearing it several thousand times from the people around me and my parents. What&#8217;s different?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A more practical example here, I was having this discussion earlier today, and someone said yes, but they&#8217;re not truly intelligent. But if you consider it, even now, we can ask Chat GPT something, and I&#8217;m going to be abstract cause I don&#8217;t have a concrete example here, I&#8217;m sorry. But we can say to ChatGPT, I want you to produce a poem in the style of Shakespeare, a sonnet or something. But I want you to use a plot from Goethe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, fine. Now it can do that. It can give you a response. I&#8217;m not sure that it&#8217;ll be a good response. I haven&#8217;t tried that particular one. But in that context, if you are asking a human to do that, and we automatically make the assumption of other human beings that they understand. And, sorry, I&#8217;m making air quotes here. That they understand, in quotes, who Goethe is. That that is a person and a character. That Goethe has a particular style and a proclivity for a certain pattern in his plots.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that those are all, to use a computer science term, symbolic representations. Abstract concepts. So is ChatGPT actually understanding those abstract concepts? Does it understand that Goethe is a person? Educated guests here, probably not. But it does understand that Goethe refers to a certain, can draw a line in all the stuff that it has learned and know this is Goethe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It has a concept of what it thinks Goethe is. Then from there it can say, and he has done work on the following things, and these are plots. And so it kind of understands. There&#8217;s another line there about what a plot is, which is a very abstract concept.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Does that mean it&#8217;s intelligent? Does that mean it understands? I don&#8217;t know. That&#8217;s my answer because I did biochemistry at university, and there&#8217;s also the question there, and it&#8217;s exactly the same question. It&#8217;s at what point do the biological machines, the biochemical machines, your actual proteins and things that are obviously on their own, unintelligent, and yet when they act in concerts, they produce a cell, and a living being.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where does that boundary exist? Is it gray? Is it a hard line? And the same for me is true of the intelligence question here. Intelligence is a, it&#8217;s an aglomeration of lots of small, well-defined things that when they start interacting, become more than the sum of their parts. Does it come down to the Turing test? I mean, the fact that people on support, little support popups on the web, have to ask, are you a human every now and then. It immediately says, we have AIs that have passed the Turing test long ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But here in this case, like the extended Turing test is the thing actually intelligent? I don&#8217;t know. I genuinely don&#8217;t know the answer there. In some sense, yes, because it&#8217;s doing almost the same thing as we are, just in a different, with different delineations and different abstractions, but the process is probably the same.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:33] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Given that you&#8217;ve got a background in, forgive me, did you say biochemistry?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:37] <strong>James Dominy:</strong> Yeah, biochemistry and computer science, bioinfomatics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:39] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, do you have an intuition as to whether the substrate of the brain has some unique capacity that can lock intelligence into it? In other words, is there a point at which a computer cannot leap the hurdle? There&#8217;s something special about the brain, the way the brain is created? This piece of wetwear in our head.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:00] <strong>James Dominy:</strong> Unpopular opinion, I think it comes down to brute force count. We&#8217;ve got trillions of cells. Large language models, I don&#8217;t know what the numbers are for GPT4, but we&#8217;re not at trillions yet. Maybe when we get there, I don&#8217;t know where the tipping point is, you know. Maybe when we get to tens of billions, or whatever number it happens to be, is the point where this thing actually becomes intelligent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we would be unable to distinguish them from a human, other than the fact that we&#8217;re looking at a screen that, that we know it&#8217;s running on the chip in front of us. But if it&#8217;s over the internet and it&#8217;s on a machine running, or whether we&#8217;re talking to a person in the support center. Or we are at the McDonald&#8217;s kiosk of 2050 and being asked whether we want fries with that. If we can&#8217;t see the person who&#8217;s asking the question, if we&#8217;re at the drive-through, we can&#8217;t see the person. Do we care?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:54] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Interesting. You mentioned a couple of times large language models, often abbreviated just to LLM. My understanding at least, forgive me I&#8217;m, I really genuinely am no expert about this. This is the underpinning of how it works. I&#8217;m going to explain it in crude terms, and then I&#8217;m hoping you&#8217;ll step in and pad it out and make it more accurate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:12] <strong>James Dominy:</strong> I should caveat anything that I say here with I also am not an expert on these, but I will do what I can.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:17] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So a large language model, my understanding is that things like ChatGPT are built on top of this, and essentially it is vacuuming up the internet. Text, images, whatever data you can throw at it. And it&#8217;s consuming that, storing that. And then at the point where you ask it something, so write a sonnet in the style of Goethe, written by Shakespeare. It&#8217;s then making a best approximation, and it&#8217;s going through a process of, okay, what should the first word be? Right, we&#8217;ve decided on that. Now, let&#8217;s figure out the second word, and the third word and the fourth word. Until finally it ends in a full stop and it&#8217;s done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s the process it&#8217;s going through. Which seems highly unintelligent. But then again, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m doing now. I&#8217;m probably selecting in some way what the next word is and what the next word is. But yeah, explain to us how these large language models work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:03] <strong>James Dominy:</strong> I think that&#8217;s a pretty fair summation. I think the important bit that needs to be filled in there is that what we perceive and use as customers of AI systems in general is a layer of several different models. There is a lot of pre-processing that goes into our prompts and post-processing in terms of what comes out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But fundamentally the large language model is, yes, it&#8217;s strings of text generally. There are different systems that the AI images, image systems, are a different form of maths. Most of them, at least the ones that I know of, are mostly based on something called Stable Diffusion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can chat about that separately, but large language models tend to be trained on a large pile of text where they develop statistical inferences for the likelihood of some sequence of words following some other sequence of words. So as you say, like, if I know that a pile of words were written by Goethe, then I can sub select that aspect of my trained data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m personifying an AI here already. The AI can circumscribe, isolate a portion of its training set, and say, okay I will use this subset of my training, and use the statistical values for what words follow what other words that Goethe wrote. And then you will get something in the style of Goethe out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:29] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It&#8217;s kind of astonishing that that works at all. That one word follows another in something which comes out as a sentence because, I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ve ever tried that experiment on your phone where you begin the predictive text. On my phone there&#8217;s there&#8217;s usually three words above the little typewriter, and it tries to say what the next word is based upon the previous word.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:49] <strong>James Dominy:</strong> It&#8217;s not called auto corrupt for nothing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:50] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, so you just click them at the end of that process, you have fantastic gibberish. It&#8217;s usually quite entertaining, and yet this system is able to, in some way just hijack that whole process and make it so that by the end the whole thing makes sense in isolation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is Goethe. It looks like Shakespeare, sounds like Shakespeare, could easily be Shakespeare. How is it predicting into the future such that by the end, the whole thing makes sense? Is there more processing going on than, okay, just the next word. Is it reading backwards?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:22] <strong>James Dominy:</strong> Yes absolutely. Again, not an expert on LLMs, but there is this thing called a Markov Model. Which is a much more linear chain. It&#8217;s used often for bioinformatics, for genome and predicting the most likely next amino acid or nucleic acid in a genomic or a proteomic sequence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so Markov Models are very simple. They have a depth and that is how much history they remember of what they&#8217;ve seen. So you point a Markov Model at the beginning of the sequence of letters of nucleic, the ACGT&#8217;s. And then you want to say, okay, I&#8217;ve managed to sequence this off my organism. I&#8217;ve got a hundred bases and I want to know what the most likely one after that is, because that&#8217;s where it got cut off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You give it a hundred, maybe you have a buffer of 10. So it remembers the last ten. It sort of slides this window of visibility over the whole sequence and mathematically starts working out, you know, what comes after an A? Okay, 30% of the time it&#8217;s a C. 50% of the time it&#8217;s a G. And by the end of it, it can with reasonable accuracy to some value of how much information you&#8217;ve given it, predict okay, in this particular portion of 10 that I&#8217;ve seen, the next one should be T.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And they get better as you give them more and more information. As you give them a bigger and bigger window. As you let them consume more and more memory whilst they&#8217;re doing their job, their accuracy increases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I imagine the same is true of large language models, because they do. They don&#8217;t just predict the next word, they operate on phrases, on whole sentences. At some point, maybe they already do, but I imagine they operate on whole paragraphs. And again, it depends on what you&#8217;re trying to produce. Like if you&#8217;re trying to produce a legal contract that&#8217;s got a fairly prescribed grammar and form to it. And you know, then like statistically you&#8217;re going to produce the same paragraph over and over again because you want the same effect out of contracts you do all the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:22] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You described this slider. That really got to the nub of it. I genuinely didn&#8217;t realize that it wasn&#8217;t doing any more than just predicting the next word. And because that&#8217;s the way I thought about it, I thought it was literally astonishing that it could throw together a sentence based upon just the next word, if it didn&#8217;t know what two words previously it had written.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s back to my predictive text, which produces pure gobbledygook. But it still, occasionally, it goes down a blind alley, doesn&#8217;t it? Because although that is, presumably 99 times out of a hundred that will lead to a cogent sentence, which is readable. Occasionally it does this thing, which I think has got the name hallucinate, where it just gets slightly derailed and goes off in a different direction. And so produces something which is, I don&#8217;t know, inaccurate, just nonsense.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:06] <strong>James Dominy:</strong> Yes. Well known for being confidently wrong for sure. I&#8217;ve experienced something similar, and I find that it is especially the case where you switch contexts. Like when you are asking it to do more than one thing at a time, and you make a change to the first thing that you expect to carry over into the context of the second task, and it just doesn&#8217;t. It gets confused.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the two things, this is especially true in coding, where you ask it to produce one piece of code and a function here, and another piece of code and a function on the other side. And you expect them, those two functions to interoperate correctly. Which means that you have to get the convention, the interface between those two things, the same on both sides.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if you say, actually, I want this to be called Bob, that doesn&#8217;t necessarily translate. Again, I suppose this is my intuition. There are a lot of ways that that failure can happen. The most obvious one is that you&#8217;re doing too much and it&#8217;s run out of tokens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tokens are sort of an abstraction. Sorry I used that word a lot. Computer scientist. Tokens are, they&#8217;re not strictly speaking individual words, but they are a rough approximation of a unit of knowledge, context. I don&#8217;t know what the right word here. They chose token, right? So, if you use the API for ChatGPT, one of the things that you pass is how many tokens is the call allowed to use?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because you are charged by tokens. And if you say only 30 tokens, you get worse answers than if you give it an allowance of a hundred tokens. Meaning that you might have given it a problem that exceeds the window that I was describing earlier. That sort of backtrack of context that it&#8217;s allowed to use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or you give it to two contexts and together they just go over and then it&#8217;s confused because it doesn&#8217;t know which, again, I say this as a semi-educated guess. We as humans don&#8217;t have a good definition of what context means in this conversation. How do we expect a computer system to?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:05] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Just as you&#8217;ve been talking, in my head, I&#8217;ve come up with this analogy of what I now think AI represents to me, and it represents essentially a very, very clever baby. There&#8217;s this child crawling around on the ground, I really do mean an infant who you fully forgive for knocking everything over and, tipping things over, damaging things and what have you. And yet this child can speak. So on the one hand, it can talk to you, but it&#8217;s just making utterly horrific mistakes because it&#8217;s a baby and you forgive it for that. So I don&#8217;t know how that sits, but that&#8217;s what&#8217;s it landed in my head.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:40] <strong>James Dominy:</strong> I wouldn&#8217;t say that AI is in its infancy anymore, but it&#8217;s probably in its toddler year, and maybe we need to watch out when it turns two.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:47] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So we&#8217;ve, done the sort of high level what is AI and all of that. That&#8217;s fascinating. But given that this is a WordPress event and it&#8217;s a WordPress podcast, let&#8217;s bind some of this stuff to the product itself. So WordPress largely is a content creation platform. You open it up, you make a post, you make a page, and typically into that goes text, sometimes images, sometimes video, possibly some other file formats. But let&#8217;s stick with the model of text and images. Why do we want, or how could we put AI into WordPress? What are the things that might be desirable in a WordPress site that AI could assist us with?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:21] <strong>James Dominy:</strong> I am totally going to be stealing some ideas from the AI content creation things that have happened this morning. I mean, there&#8217;s the obvious answer. I need to generate a thousand words for my editor by 4:00 PM today. Hey, ChatGPT, can you generate a thousand words on topic, blah?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think there are a lot of other places. I&#8217;d be super surprised if this hasn&#8217;t actually happened already. But, hey ChatGPT, write me an article that gets me to the top five Google ranking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other obvious place for me as a software developer is using it to develop code. Humans are inventive. We&#8217;re going to see a lot of uses for AI that we never thought of. That&#8217;s not a bad thing at all. The more ways that we can use AI, I think the better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, there are questions about the dangers, and I&#8217;m sure that&#8217;s a question coming up later on, so I won&#8217;t dive into them now, but in the WordPress community, there&#8217;s content creation, but there&#8217;s also content moderation, where AI can probably help a lot. Analyze this piece of text to me and tell me is it spam? Does it contain harmful or hateful content?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, it&#8217;s a case of you get what you give. There&#8217;s that story about Microsoft, I think it was Microsoft, and the chatbot that turned into a horrible Nazi racist within about two hours, having been trained on Twitter data. We need to be careful about that, certainly. I&#8217;m struggling to think of things beyond the obvious.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:47] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Well, I think probably it is going to be the obvious, isn&#8217;t it? Largely, people are popping in text and so having something which will allow you within the interface, whether you are in a page builder or whether you&#8217;re using the Gutenberg editor, the ability to interrupt that flow and say, okay, I&#8217;ve written enough now, ChatGPT, take over. Give me the next 300 words please. Or just read what I&#8217;ve written and can you just finish this? I&#8217;m almost there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:11] <strong>James Dominy:</strong> Yeah, we are doing it already, even if it&#8217;s a sort of fairly primitive flow now where we write some stuff in our block editor, copy it up, pop it in ChatGPT or Bard or whatever, and say, hey, this is too formal. Or this is not formal enough. And it&#8217;s really great at that. Make this sound more businessy. And it understands the word businessy. The tool integration, it&#8217;s obvious in a lot of ways, but I think there are going to be a lot of non-obvious integrations. Like, oh wow, I wish I thought of that, and, you know, made my millions off that product. I mean, Jetpack is doing it already, you know. I am able to actively engage with ChatGPT whilst I&#8217;m editing my blog post. Fantastic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another thing that I&#8217;ve just thought of is oh, I run a WooCommerce site and I want to use, not necessarily ChatGPT, but some other AI system to analyze product sales and use that to promote, to change the listing on my product site, so that I can sell more product. That&#8217;s going to happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:09] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, given that it&#8217;s incredibly good at consuming data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:13] <strong>James Dominy:</strong> Yeah, or even generating it on the fly. Generate 300 different descriptions of this product and randomize them. Put them out there and see which one sells best. We are doing that manually already. It&#8217;s AB testing at a larger scale.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:28] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. You can imagine a situation where the AI runs the split test, but it&#8217;s divided over 300 variations. And it decides for itself which is the winner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:39] <strong>James Dominy:</strong> On a day-to-day basis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:40] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> On an hourly basis. Implements the winner and then begins the whole process over and over again. I also wonder if in WordPress there is going to be AI to help lay out things. So at the moment we have the block editor. It enables you to create fairly complex layouts. We also have page builders, which allow us to do the same thing. So it alludes to what I was speaking about a moment ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Talking, so literally talking, as well as typing in. I would like a homepage. I would like that homepage to show off my plumbing business, and here&#8217;s my telephone number. I&#8217;d like to have a picture of me, or somebody doing some plumbing, some additional content down there. You get the picture?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:17] <strong>James Dominy:</strong> Yeah, absolutely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:18] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> A few little prompts, and rather than spitting out text or an image, whole layouts come out. And we can pick from 300 different layouts. I&#8217;ll go for that one, but now make the buttons red. The AI takes over the design process in a way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:32] <strong>James Dominy:</strong> Yeah. I&#8217;m going to confess here that I&#8217;m absolutely stealing this opinion from the AI panel earlier. I think the danger for WordPress specifically there, is that that level of automation for us with human engagement and, you know, developing something through conversation with an AI, might actually skip WordPress entirely. Why must the AI choose WordPress to do this?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe if we as a WordPress community invest in making WordPress AI integrated, then yeah, absolutely. Then hopefully we&#8217;re first to market with that in a way. And then it will generate stuff in WordPress. But there&#8217;s no, there&#8217;s no reason for it to maybe choose a Wix page as a better solution for you as a plumber, who doesn&#8217;t update things very often. You just want a static, you know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chances are it&#8217;ll just say, here is some HTML it does the job for you, it&#8217;s pretty. I made some images for you as well. And, all you need to do is run the sequence of commands to, SSH it up to provider of your choice. Or I have selected this provider because I know how much they all charge and this is the cheapest. Or you&#8217;ve asked for the fastest, whatever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:41] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Oh, interesting, okay. So it&#8217;s not just bound inside the WordPress interface. Literally, put this in the cheapest place as of today. And then if it changes in the next 24 hours, just move it over there and change the DNS for me and.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:53] <strong>James Dominy:</strong> One day. For sure. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:54] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay. So that very nicely ties into the harms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:58] <strong>James Dominy:</strong> There it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:58] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> What we&#8217;ve just laid out is potentially quite harmful to a lot of the jobs that people do inside of WordPress. We&#8217;ve just described a workflow in which many of the things that we would charge clients for, which we could potentially get AI to do. Whether that&#8217;s a voice interface or a visual interface or a type, we&#8217;re typing in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that is concerning, if we are giving AI the option to put us out of work. And I know at the moment, this is the hot topic. I&#8217;m pretty sure that there&#8217;s some fairly large organizations who have begun this process already. They&#8217;ve taken some staff who are doing jobs which can be swapped out for AI, and they&#8217;ve shed those staff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And whilst we&#8217;re in the beginning phase of that, it seems like we can swallow so much of people getting laid off. The problem, potentially is, if we keep laying people off over and over and over again and we give everything over to the AI, we suddenly are in a position where, well, there&#8217;s no humans in this whole process anymore. Does any of that give you pause for thought?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:53] <strong>James Dominy:</strong> Yeah, it certainly does. I think we should temper our expectations of the capabilities of AI. So there&#8217;s a technical term called a terminal goal. The delineation between specific artificial intelligences and machine learning, in that world, and the concept of the general artificial intelligences, which is what everyone thinks of when they think of the I in artificial intelligence, is an AI that is capable of forming its own terminal goals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Its own, don&#8217;t get me wrong, like we have AIs that are capable of forming what are called intermediate nodes. If you tell an AI of a particular type to go and do a particular thing, then it is capable of forming intermediate steps. In order to do the thing you&#8217;ve told me, I need to first do this, which requires me to do that. And, you know, it forms a chain of goals, but none of those goals are emergent from the AI. They are towards a goal we have given the AI externally.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That ability to form a goal internally is the concept of a terminal goal. And we don&#8217;t have, large language models don&#8217;t have terminal goals. Large language models, stable diffusion, all of the different algorithms that are hot topics today, are all couched within the idea of solving a problem given to them as an input.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which means there&#8217;s always going to need to be a human. At least with what we&#8217;ve got now. No matter how good these models get, how much brain power we give them. And this maybe is going against what I said earlier of like, I think it&#8217;s probably a quantity thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe there&#8217;s a tipping point. Maybe there&#8217;s a tipping point where the intermediate goal that it forms is indistinguishable from a terminal goal in a human brain. But for the moment, I think there always needs to be a human there to give the AI the task to solve. Open AI isn&#8217;t just running servers randomly just doing stuff. It spends its computational time answering users prompts and questions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:48] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So if we pursue artificial intelligence research, and the end goal is to create an AGI, then presumably at some point we&#8217;ve got something which is indistinguishable from a human because it can set its own goals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:02] <strong>James Dominy:</strong> The cyberpunk dystopia, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:03] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> But we&#8217;re not there yet. This is a ways off, my understanding at least anyway. But in the more short term, let&#8217;s bind it to the loss of jobs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:11] <strong>James Dominy:</strong> In my workshop this morning, I think the primary point that I wanted to get across is, if you are currently in the WordPress community, employed and or making an income out of WordPress. ChatGPT, Bard, generative AI, large language models are a tool that you should be learning to use. They&#8217;re not going to replace you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe that&#8217;s less true on the content generation side, because large language models are particularly good at that. But there&#8217;s a flip side to that because on the software development side, programming languages have very strict grammars, which means the statistical model is particularly good at producing output for programming languages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s not good at handling the large amounts of complexity that can exist in large pieces of code. But equally so, I mean, if you ask it to give you a hundred items of things to do in Athens, whilst I&#8217;m totally, totally, working hard at a conference, uh, then you are probably going to get repeats. You might run into the confusion problem, the hallucination issue at some point there, where just a hundred is too much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nobody has ever written an article of a hundred things to do in Athens in a day. I don&#8217;t know, I haven&#8217;t tried that. I&#8217;m guessing that there are going to be limitations. So some jobs are more in threat than others, but I think that if you&#8217;re already in the industry, or in the community and working with it, go with it and, absorb the tools into your day-to-day flow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s going to make you better at what you do. Faster at what you do. Hopefully able to make more money. Hopefully able to communicate with more people, translations et cetera. Make your blog multilingual. There are a lot of things that you can use it for that aren&#8217;t immediately coming after your job.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem for me, and this again is the point that I was trying to get across in the workshop, the problem is the next generation. The people who are getting into WordPress today and tomorrow, and in six months time. Who are coming into a world where AI is already in such usage that it&#8217;s solving the simple problems. And the same as true, my editor wants 200 words or whatever on fun things to do in Athens overnight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, great. ChatGPT can do that for the editor. Why does he need a junior content writer anymore? But the problem is, I mean, we&#8217;ve already said, sometimes it&#8217;s spectacularly wrong. Does that editor always have the time to actually vet the output? Probably not. And so the job of that junior is going to transform into, they need to be a subeditor. They need to be a content moderator almost, rather than a content generator.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that&#8217;s a skill that only comes from having written the content yourself. We learn by making mistakes, and if we are not making those mistakes because AI is generating the stuff, and either not making mistakes or making mistakes that we haven&#8217;t made before ourselves, and thus don&#8217;t recognize his mistakes. So my fear of the job losses aspect of AI is not that it&#8217;s going to wipe out people who are working already. It&#8217;s going to make that barrier to entry for the next generation, it&#8217;s knocking the bottom rung out of the ladder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And unless we change the ways that we teach people as they are entering the community, the WordPress community, the industry, and all the industries which AI is going to affect, the basics, and we focus on it. You know, it&#8217;s a catch 22. We have to teach people to do stuff without AI, so they can learn the basics. But at the same time, they also have to learn how to use AI so they can do the basics in the modern world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I mean, we get back to that old debate like, why am I learning trigonometry in school? Because maybe someday it actually helps you do your job. Admittedly, so far, not so much. But I will say this. History, I did history in school. That has surprisingly turned out to be one of the most useful subjects I ever did, just because it taught me how to write. Which I didn&#8217;t learn in English class. Go figure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:17] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It sounds like you are quite sanguine for now. If you are in the space and listening to this podcast now, everything is fine right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:26] <strong>James Dominy:</strong> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:27] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Maybe less sanguine for the future. Given that, do you think that AI more broadly needs to be corralled. There need to be guardrails put in place. There needs to be legislation. I don&#8217;t know how any of that works, but manufacturers of AI being put under the auspices of, well it would have to be governments, I guess. But some kind of system of checks and balances to make sure that it&#8217;s not, I don&#8217;t know, deliberately producing fakes. Or that the fakes are getting, the hallucinations are getting minimized. That it&#8217;s not doing things that aren&#8217;t in humanity&#8217;s best interests.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:59] <strong>James Dominy:</strong> Absolutely. Yes. Although I&#8217;m not sure how we could do a good job of it, to be fair. The whole concept of, we want AIs to operate in humanity&#8217;s best interests. Who decides? The alignment problem crops up here where, it&#8217;s well known that we can train an AI to do something we think that it&#8217;s going to do, and it seems to be doing that thing until suddenly it doesn&#8217;t.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we just get some weird output. And then when we go digging, we realize actually it was trying to solve an entirely different problem to what we thought we were training it on, that just happened to have a huge amount of overlap with the thing that we did. But when we get to those edge cases, it goes off in what we think is a wildly wrong direction. But it is solving the problem that it was trained to solve. We just didn&#8217;t know we were training it to solve that problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As far as regulation goes. Yes, I think regulation, it&#8217;s coming. I really want to say nobody could be stupid enough to put weapons in the hands of an AI. The human race has proved me wrong several thousand times already in history. Yeesh, I personally think that that&#8217;s an incredibly stupid idea. But then the problem becomes what&#8217;s a weapon?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because a weapon these days can be something as subtle as enough ability to control trading, high frequency trading. Accidentally crash a stock market. It&#8217;s already happened. Accidentally, and again, I&#8217;m air quoting the accidentally here, accidentally crash your competitor&#8217;s stock, or another nation&#8217;s stock market. AI is there, is being used as a validly useful tool to participate in the economy, but the economy can be used as a weapon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Putting AI in control of the water infrastructure in arid countries. Optimization, it can do those jobs a lot better. It can see almost instantaneously when there&#8217;s a pressure drop. So there&#8217;s a leak in this section of the pipe. Somebody needs to go fix it. And also it can just shut off the water to an entire section of the city because, I don&#8217;t know, it feels like it. Because for some reason it is optimizing for a different goal than we actually think we gave it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The trick is we can say, we can input into ChatGPT, I want you to provide water to the entire city in a fair and equitable way. That doesn&#8217;t mean that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s going to do. We just think that that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s going to do. We hope.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:42:26] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I think we kind of come back to where we started. If we had a crystal ball, and we could stare five, two years, three years, 10 years into the future. That feels like it would be a really great thing to have at the moment. There&#8217;s obviously going to be benefits. It&#8217;s going to make work certainly more productive. It&#8217;s going to make us be able to produce more things. But as you&#8217;ve just talked over the last 20 minutes or so, there&#8217;s also points of concern and things to be ironed out in the near term.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:42:52] <strong>James Dominy:</strong> Absolutely, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:42:53] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> We&#8217;re fast running out of time, so I think we&#8217;ll wrap it up if that&#8217;s all right? A quick one James, if somebody is interested, you&#8217;ve planted the seed of interest about AI and they want to get in touch with you and natter about this some more, where would they do that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:43:06] <strong>James Dominy:</strong> The best way is probably email. I am not a social person in the social media sense. I don&#8217;t have Twitter. I don&#8217;t do any of that. So I&#8217;m probably terrible for this when I think about it. My email is, J for Juliet, G for golf, my surname D O M for mother, I, N for November, Y for yankee at gmail.com. Please don&#8217;t spam. Please don&#8217;t get AI to spam me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:43:30] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, yeah. James Dominy, thank you so much for joining us today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:43:34] <strong>James Dominy:</strong> Thank you for the opportunity. It&#8217;s been great fun, and I&#8217;ve really enjoyed being able to kind of deep dive into a lot of the stuff I just had to gloss over in the workshop. Thank you.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today we have <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamesdominy/?originalSubdomain=ie\">James Dominy</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>James is a computer scientist with a masters degree in bioinformatics. He lives in Ireland, working at the WPEngine Limerick office.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the second podcast recorded at WordCamp Europe 2023 in Athens. James gave a talk at the event about the influence of AI on the WordPress community, and how it’s going to disrupt so many of the roles which WordPressers currently occupy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We talk about the recent rise of ChatGPT and the fact that it’s made AI available to almost anyone. In less than twelve months many of us have gone from never touching AI technologies to using them on a daily basis to speed up some aspect of our work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The discussion moves on to the rate at which AI systems might evolve, and whether or not they’re truly intelligent, or just a suite of technologies which masquerade as intelligent. Are they merely good at predicting the next word or phrase in any given sentence? Is there a scenario in which we can expect our machines to stop simply regurgitating text and images based upon what they’ve consumed; a future in which they can set their own agendas and learn based upon their own goals?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This gets into the subject of whether or not AI is in any meaningful way innately intelligent, or just good at making us think that it is, and whether or not the famous Turing test is a worthwhile measure of the abilities of an AI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>James’ background in biochemistry comes in handy as we turn our attention to whether or not there’s something unique about the brains we all possess, or if intelligence is merely a matter of the amount of compute power that an AI can consume. It’s more or less certain that given time, machines will be more capable than they are now, so when, if ever, does the intelligence Rubicon get crossed?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The current AI systems can be broadly classified as Large Language Models, or LLMs for short, and James explains what these are and how they work. How can they create a sentence word by word if they don’t have an understanding of where each sentence is going to end up? James explains that LLMs are a little more complex than just handling one word at a time, always moving backwards and forwards within their predictions to ensure that they’re creating content which makes sense, even if it’s not always factually accurate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We then move on from the conceptual understanding of AI to more concrete ways it can be implemented. What ways can WordPress users implement AI right now, and what innovations might we reasonably expect to be available in the future? Will we be able to get AI to make intelligent decisions about our website’s SEO or design, and therefore be able to focus our time on other, more pressing, matters?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a fascinating conversation whether or not you’ve used AI tools in the past.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Useful links.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt\">ChatGPT</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://stablediffusionweb.com/\">Stable Diffusion</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_model\">Markov Model</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 28 Jun 2023 14:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Nathan Wrigley\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:21;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:54:\"Akismet: How to Add CAPTCHA and reCAPTCHA to WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:27:\"http://akismet.com/?p=70973\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:43:\"https://akismet.com/blog/wordpress-captcha/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:25456:\"<p>Implementing a CAPTCHA or reCAPTCHA system is a highly effective way to protect your WordPress website or ecommerce business from spam and bots, which is crucial for ensuring online security.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All that sounds great, but the effort involved in solving a CAPTCHA often results in reduced conversions. According to <a href=\"https://moz.com/blog/having-a-captcha-is-killing-your-conversion-rate\">Moz</a>, including a CAPTCHA could result in a loss of 3.2% of conversions. Yikes!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s why today, we&#8217;ll explain the problem with the traditional CAPTCHA setup, offer a stand-out alternative, and provide steps to add CAPTCHA and reCAPTCHA to your WordPress site, if that&#8217;s still the route you feel most comfortable with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After following this guide, your website will be safer and more secure for your visitors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s get started!</p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-70973\"></span>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The problem with traditional CAPTCHA solutions</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While <a href=\"https://support.google.com/a/answer/1217728?hl=en#:~:text=CAPTCHA%20(Completely%20Automated%20Public%20Turing,known%20as%20challenge%2Dresponse%20authentication.\">CAPTCHA</a> systems have been widely adopted for their ability to prevent spam and bot activity, they do come with a number of drawbacks. Make sure you’re aware of these downsides before you use a WordPress CAPTCHA plugin.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. They’re challenging for those with visual impairments</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Traditional CAPTCHA systems often rely on distorted images of text, making it difficult for users with visual impairments to solve them. This can lead to accessibility issues and discourage visitors from interacting with your site.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/image12.png\" alt=\"example of a CAPTCHA asking the user to select squares with red spheres\" class=\"wp-image-70975\" width=\"385\" height=\"463\" />\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. They create a frustrating experience&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>CAPTCHAs can be frustrating and time-consuming to solve, particularly when the distorted text is difficult to read. This annoyance can cause people to leave your site without completing their intended action, such as submitting a form or making a purchase. Sometimes, visitors may even have to solve multiple CAPTCHAs —&nbsp;a real test of endurance.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. They can generate false positives</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>CAPTCHA systems can sometimes incorrectly identify real human users as bots, preventing them from accessing your site or submitting forms. This can lead to a loss of leads, customers, or subscribers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. They’re easily bypassed by sophisticated bots</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As bots become more advanced, they’re increasingly able to bypass traditional CAPTCHA systems, rendering them less effective at preventing spam and malicious activity on your site.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. They can create a negative user experience</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Implementing CAPTCHA systems can negatively impact your site&#8217;s user experience, particularly when the CAPTCHAs are overly complex or difficult to solve. This can lead to lower visitor satisfaction and, ultimately, decreased engagement and conversions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6. They can lead to lower conversion rates</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As mentioned above, the frustrating experience of solving CAPTCHAs can lead to users abandoning your site before completing their intended actions. This can result in lower conversion rates for your business.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">7. They can cause higher page load times</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Implementing CAPTCHA systems can also contribute to slower page load times, as they often require additional resources and scripts to load. This can negatively impact your site&#8217;s performance and search engine rankings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given these challenges, it&#8217;s important to find a solution that’s both effective at preventing spam and bots, while also providing a positive user experience. That&#8217;s where Akismet comes in to save the day.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How does Akismet address these issues?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Akismet addresses the shortcomings of traditional CAPTCHA systems by employing advanced algorithms and a continuously-updated database of spam signatures. It can effectively identify and block spam and malicious activity without any user input and without annoying barriers for site visitors.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The result is enhanced accessibility, a superior user experience, and fewer false positives.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even the most sophisticated bots can be identified and blocked by Akismet due to its advanced spam detection technology and constantly-updated database. By staying ahead of emerging threats, Akismet ensures your online presence remains secure and your valuable content and data are safeguarded.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The benefits of using Akismet over CAPTCHA</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Given the challenges associated with traditional CAPTCHA solutions, Akismet presents several benefits that make it a compelling and superior alternative for WordPress site owners.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Greater user-friendliness</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Akismet doesn&#8217;t require users to solve puzzles or enter codes, ensuring a more pleasant and frustration-free browsing experience. It operates seamlessly in the background, allowing visitors to focus on your content and offerings without any distractions or interruptions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Improved accessibility for all users</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Akismet can be used by people with vision impairments because it doesn’t use visual puzzles to block spam and bots. This approach makes sure that your website is user-friendly and welcoming to a diverse audience, creating a positive online environment for everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Greater accuracy in spam detection</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Akismet uses advanced algorithms and a vast database of spam signatures to minimize false positives. This means that genuine users can access and interact with your site without being mistakenly identified as bots. This accurate spam detection helps build a trustworthy online presence and improve user experiences.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Robust effectiveness against malicious activity</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Akismet is highly effective at identifying and blocking spam and malicious activity, including sophisticated bots that can bypass traditional CAPTCHA systems. Its constantly-updated database and advanced spam detection technology ensure your website remains secure and protected from emerging threats.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Optimized performance and load times</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Akismet runs in the background and won&#8217;t slow down your website by using extra data or running unnecessary scripts. This means your website will stay fast and responsive for your visitors, which can help improve your search engine rankings and create a great browsing experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If this sounds like a solid prospect, you&#8217;ll be delighted to hear that we&#8217;re discussing how to install and set up Akismet on WordPress next.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to add Akismet to WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Incorporating <a href=\"https://akismet.com/\">Akismet</a> into WordPress comment and contact forms is a breeze, and you can accomplish it in just a few steps. However, the procedure might differ slightly depending on the contact form or plugin you&#8217;re using. Let&#8217;s explore how it&#8217;s done!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Step 1: Install the Akismet plugin</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Akismet can be used for free to get rid of spam <a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/wordpress-pros-and-cons-of-enabling-comments/\">comments</a> and harmful form submissions on your non-commercial site. Websites run for commercial purposes can choose from several affordable premium options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, install and activate the plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To do this, log in to your WordPress dashboard, go to the <strong>Plugins</strong> tab, click <strong>Add New</strong>, and search for it. The plugin is usually included in the top &#8220;<strong>Featured</strong>&#8221; list.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/image6.png\" alt=\"finding Akismet in the WordPress repository\" class=\"wp-image-70976\" width=\"450\" height=\"197\" />\n\n\n\n<p>To install the plugin, click on<strong> Install Now</strong> and then <strong>Activate</strong>. After activation, go to <strong>Settings</strong> and select <strong>Akismet Anti-Spam</strong>. Under <strong>Settings</strong>, locate the <strong>API key</strong> field.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can get the key by going to the Akismet website and creating an account.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/image7.png\" alt=\"Aksimet homepage with the text, \" />\n\n\n\n<p>Once you finish the signup process on the website, log in to your new account then locate <strong>My Account</strong> and choose <strong>Add Subscription</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can select your desired plan next. The <strong>Personal</strong> plan is free for individual website use if your site is considered &#8220;non-commercial.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After registering, you’ll receive an API key in the My Account section. Copy this key and then navigate to the WordPress dashboard&#8217;s <strong>Settings → Akismet Anti-Spam</strong> screen. Next, paste the key into the <strong>API Key</strong> field.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/image1.png\" alt=\"Akismet settings in WordPress\" class=\"wp-image-70979\" width=\"450\" height=\"267\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Click on <strong>Save Changes</strong> to finish.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Akismet will automatically filter comment spam and put it in a queue for review on the dashboard. But if you want it to work on your contact form(s), you&#8217;ll need to complete another step.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Step 2: Add Akismet to your contact form</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>By default, WordPress does not have a contact form feature. Therefore, you’ll need to use plugins to include contact forms on their sites. The method to add these forms will vary based on the plugin being used.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some popular contact form plugins, including <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/features/discussion/contact-forms/\">Jetpack</a>, already have Akismet support built-in.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other plugins necessitate setting up Akismet add-ons to incorporate spam protection into their forms. <a href=\"https://www.gravityforms.com/\">Gravity Forms</a> is the most popular example of this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still other WordPress plugins like <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/\">Contact Form 7</a> require a code snippet to add Akismet support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thankfully, it&#8217;s easy to configure Akismet on your contact forms, no matter which method you choose.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Step 3: Set up the anti-spam settings in Akismet</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Akismet is very much a set-it-and-forget-it type of tool. Just install, activate, and you&#8217;re basically done. But it also allows you to control how to handle contact form spam a bit more precisely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin is configured, by default, to send flagged comments to a holding queue located in the <strong>Comments</strong> section of the WordPress dashboard so that you can review them later. You can also set up Akismet to delete spam entirely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If this sounds appealing, just go to<strong> Settings → Akismet Anti-Spam</strong> and locate the <strong>Settings</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Scroll down to the section called <strong>Strictness</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/image10.png\" alt=\"Strictness settings for Akismet\" class=\"wp-image-70980\" width=\"450\" height=\"170\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Akismet is good at identifying which messages are spam and which ones are legitimate, which means you can delete the spam messages from your contact form without worry. However, if you want to keep all messages, you can select the option to <strong>Always put spam in the Spam folder for review</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember that Akismet stores spam comments for 15 days before they&#8217;re deleted. So, if you go for this option, review your queue regularly.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Still want to use CAPTCHA?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Although we suggest using Akismet due to its ease-of-use and success in blocking spam and bots, we realize that certain users may still want to learn how to add CAPTCHA to WordPress. This section will provide clear instructions on how to integrate both CAPTCHA and reCAPTCHA into a WordPress contact form.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. How to add CAPTCHA to a WordPress contact form</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Although most well-known contact form plugins include CAPTCHA functionality, you can also manually incorporate CAPTCHA into any form element on WordPress that&#8217;s being misused. This not only includes contact forms, but also comment forms, <a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/how-to-enable-or-disable-user-registration-in-wordpress/\">user registration pages</a>, login pages, and opt-in forms.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Step 1: Install and activate the Friendly CAPTCHA for WordPress plugin</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>For the purposes of this tutorial, we&#8217;re using the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/friendly-captcha/\">Friendly CAPTCHA for WordPress</a> plugins, though there are other options available.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Go to your WordPress dashboard then to <strong>Plugins → Add New</strong> and search for the plugin by name.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/image8-1.png\" alt=\"Friendly Captcha for WordPress plugin\" class=\"wp-image-70982\" width=\"225\" height=\"188\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Once you locate it, click <strong>Install → Activate</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Step 2: Add the site key and secret key</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>To input your<strong> </strong>Site key and Secret key, locate<strong> Friendly Captcha</strong> in the dashboard, then click <strong>Settings</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then go to the <a href=\"https://friendlycaptcha.com\">Friendly Captcha</a> website and create an account. Pick a plan, then copy your site key.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/image5.png\" alt=\"creating a Friendly Captcha account\" class=\"wp-image-70983\" width=\"450\" height=\"199\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Go back to your WordPress installation and paste in the<strong> Site key</strong> in the appropriate field. Then go back to your account on the website and generate an API key by typing in a name for it then clicking <strong>Create API Key.</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/image13.png\" alt=\"creating an API key\" class=\"wp-image-70984\" width=\"450\" height=\"195\" />\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Step 3: Finish configuring settings</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>For this tutorial, please select the comment form box to enable forms and keep all other settings at their default values to configure the remaining options based on your preferences.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Step 4: Save and view</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you&#8217;re done making changes, click <strong>Save Changes,</strong> then visit a live blog post to verify the comment form is working as intended.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. How to add reCAPTCHA to a WordPress contact form</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Google reCAPTCHA adds an extra layer of protection to your contact forms, using a two-step verification process. This tool can help stop bots and spammers, as they&#8217;ll need to pass the reCAPTCHA test. You can use a WordPress CAPTCHA plugin to get the job done. Here&#8217;s how you can incorporate it into your WordPress contact form:</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Step 1: Install and activate a WordPress reCAPTCHA plugin</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>First, install and activate the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-google-recaptcha/\">Simple Google reCAPTCHA plugin</a>. Just search for it by name under <strong>Plugins → Add New</strong>. Then click <strong>Install → Activate</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/image11.png\" alt=\"the Simple Google reCAPTCHA plugin\" class=\"wp-image-70985\" width=\"450\" height=\"251\" />\n\n\n\n<p>After activation, navigate to<strong> Settings → Google reCAPTCHA</strong> to configure the plugin settings.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Step 2: Configure the plugin settings</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin will prompt you to enter Google reCAPTCHA keys. You can obtain these keys for free from the official reCAPTCHA website by clicking the <strong>register your domain</strong> link at the top of the page.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/image2.png\" alt=\"warning to register your domain \" class=\"wp-image-70986\" width=\"450\" height=\"65\" />\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Step 3: Obtain reCAPTCHA API keys by registering your website</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The <strong>register your domain</strong> link directs you to the Google reCAPTCHA website, where you can register your site to work with reCAPTCHA.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sign in with your Google account, and you&#8217;ll see the <strong>Register a new site</strong> page.

Check the comment section of your blog posts to ensure it&#8217;s working correctly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So now you know how to add CAPTCHA or reCAPTCHA to your WordPress contact forms. Although these options can reduce spam and bot activity, we suggest using Akismet instead because it is easy to use, more accessible, and effective against advanced bots.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless of the solution you choose, however, keeping your WordPress site secure from spam and malicious activity is crucial for maintaining a positive user experience, safeguarding your online presence, and protecting your reputation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Frequently asked questions about CAPTCHA and reCAPTCHA</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Still curious about CAPTCHA, reCAPTCHA, and how to safeguard the contact forms on your website? Let&#8217;s take a look at some answers to the most commonly asked questions on the subject.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is CAPTCHA?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>CAPTCHA, which stands for “Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart”, is a security measure used on websites to prevent automated bots from submitting forms, leaving comments, or performing other actions that should only be done by human users. CAPTCHAs typically require users to solve visual puzzles — such as identifying distorted text or selecting specific images — to prove that they’re not bots.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is reCAPTCHA?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>reCAPTCHA is a more advanced version of CAPTCHA developed by Google. It improves upon traditional CAPTCHA systems by incorporating machine learning and advanced risk analysis techniques to better differentiate between human users and bots. reCAPTCHA is designed to be more user-friendly, with some versions requiring people only to click a checkbox.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/image3.png\" alt=\"I\'m not a robot checkbox\" class=\"wp-image-70990\" width=\"315\" height=\"86\" />\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is Akismet?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Akismet is a powerful anti-spam solution for WordPress websites, developed by Automattic, the company behind WordPress.com. It uses advanced algorithms and a continuously-updated database of spam signatures to identify and block spam comments and form submissions, without requiring user input or creating accessibility barriers. Akismet operates in the background (kind of like an invisible CAPTCHA, in a sense), providing a seamless and user-friendly browsing experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Is Akismet better than CAPTCHA and reCAPTCHA?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While each solution has its own advantages, Akismet is generally considered more user-friendly and accessible compared to CAPTCHA and reCAPTCHA. It doesn&#8217;t require users to solve puzzles or enter codes, making it easier for those with visual impairments and providing a smoother browsing experience overall. Akismet is also highly effective at blocking spam and bots, even as they evolve and become more sophisticated.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Does Akismet integrate with contact form plugins like Contact Form 7?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, Akismet integrates with many popular WordPress contact form plugins, including Contact Form 7. By connecting Akismet to your contact form plugin, you can effectively protect your forms from spam submissions without the need for CAPTCHA or reCAPTCHA.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What are real-world examples of sites using Akismet?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Akismet is trusted by over 100 million websites worldwide, including well-known enterprise brands such as <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/\">Microsoft</a>, <a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/convertkit-customerstory/\">ConvertKit</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.bluehost.com/\">Bluehost</a>. Its widespread adoption and use by major companies serve as strong social proof for its effectiveness in preventing spam and ensuring a secure, user-friendly online experience.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Should you choose Akismet for your contact and registration forms, you&#8217;ll be in good company, joining millions of other websites that have successfully protected their online presence from spam and malicious activity.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Akismet: Non-intrusive spam protection for WordPress&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To keep your WordPress site free from <a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/spambots-theyre-not-just-like-us-introducing-akismets-newest-spam-fighting-feature/\">spam and bots</a> while ensuring a good user experience and accessibility, you should use Akismet. It offers an effective way to combat spam that doesn&#8217;t disrupt your site visitors&#8217; browsing experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you add Akismet to your WordPress site, it will use complex calculations and a big collection of spam markers to keep your site safe from unwanted content. In addition, it integrates smoothly with well-known tools for contact forms, making sure that everyone can use your website securely and without hassle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While CAPTCHA and reCAPTCHA may still be preferred by some, Akismet stands out as a user-friendly, effective, and accessible alternative for securing your WordPress contact forms against spam and bots. And by choosing Akismet, you&#8217;re investing in the success of your online presence and ensuring a pleasant experience for your visitors, which is definitely worth prioritizing.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 28 Jun 2023 13:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12:\"Kathryn Marr\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:22;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"WPTavern: WordPress 6.3 Will Introduce A Command Palette\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=146321\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-6-3-will-introduce-a-command-palette\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3341:\"<p>Last week Gutenberg contributors were engaged in a spirited debate regarding <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-contributors-discuss-renaming-command-center-tool\">a proposal to rename the new Command Center to Wayfinder</a>. The feature, designed to be an extensible quick search and command execution tool, will land in WordPress 6.3.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The majority of participants in the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/50925\">discussion</a> were strongly against calling it Wayfinder, as the term doesn&#8217;t translate well, nor does it make the feature&#8217;s benefits easy to understand.  Wayfinder was proposed as a unique name that &#8220;has the potential to evoke a sense of curiosity, exploration, and discovery.&#8221; There were several attempts to wrap up the discussion with notes on alternatives even when it was apparent that the general consensus was unequivocally not in favor of the term Wayfinder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Automattic-sponsored Gutenberg contributor Anne McCarthy <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/50925#issuecomment-1610044400\">commented</a> on the issue with the decision, which she said was reached after consulting project leadership and reading through the comments:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p><em><strong>Let’s move forward with Command Palette.</strong></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reasoning: easier to translate, consistent across other tooling outside of WordPress, matches current functionality, eases discoverability/understanding of value, and leans generic which matches the concerns raised here. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, we can always discuss renaming if the feature reaches a point of evolution outside of this initial name. As raised above, that would be more worth risking a unique name for than something that exists in other products and that ultimately we want people to quickly understand/find value in. Plus if we hold off on that name for the future, it can create a nice marketing push for something truly unique when/if the time comes. If folks have additional specific concerns around this naming, please speak up sooner rather than later.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>McCarthy also requested other contributors ensure the re-naming is updated throughout the interface for the upcoming release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was an important decision that needed to be made ahead of WordPress 6.3 Beta 1, which was supposed to be released today but was <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/06/27/wordpress-6-3-beta-1-postponed/\">delayed</a> to Wednesday, June 28, due to an unrelated issue. The Command Palette will likely be introduced in blog posts, the 6.3 About page, and countless third-party resources so the proposal urgently needed a conclusion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s also to the team’s credit that they didn’t force a fancy marketing name and instead landed on the side of the majority of contributors who were in favor of using clear language. The API for the Command Palette <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/51169\">is now public</a> and ready for developers to create their own custom commands. Using a term that is easy to understand and translate will engender more global community buy-in, as <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/stats/\">52% of WordPress users</a> run the software in a language other than English.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 28 Jun 2023 01:46:35 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:23;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:51:\"WPTavern: WordCamp Europe 2024 Calls for Organizers\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=146294\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:62:\"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-europe-2024-calls-for-organizers\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3609:\"<p>WordCamp Europe 2023 in Athens attracted more than 2,500 attendees from 94 countries, made possible by 112 organizers and 250 volunteers.

The difference was that reusable blocks can be created and edited in the block editor and then reused in other places &#8211; inserted into posts or pages.

They give users the ability to apply the same layout to different posts and pages. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reusable blocks have now been <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/51144\">renamed to patterns</a>, with the option to be synced, which offers the same functionality as the former reusable blocks where all instances can be updated at once. Non-synced patterns are just regular patterns &#8211; those that can be edited independently of other other instances that have been inserted. These updates are coming in Gutenberg 16.1 and will be included in the upcoming WordPress 6.3 release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress contributor Aki Hamano posted a diagram to Twitter regarding the renaming, which was confirmed as an accurate representation of the changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I am trying to understand about the new naming of \"Pattern\" in WordPress.

Learning materials and documentation will need to be updated with very little notice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gutenberg contributor Daniel Richards encouraged contributors to see the change as part of &#8220;<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/41717\">the great unification</a>,&#8221; an effort towards consolidating the many different block types into a single concept and streamlining the content and site editors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;In the future it might also be possible for template parts to be considered &#8216;synced patterns&#8217;, and at that point things become much more streamlined and there are far fewer concepts for users to grasp,&#8221; Gutenberg contributor Daniel Richards said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;So the hope is that this is a first step on the path to making things easier for users, rather than more difficult. But I do realize that for existing users it&#8217;s quite a shift.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As part of this effort, WordPress 6.3 will also introduce pattern creation in the block editor using the same interface that it previously used for reusable blocks. Pattern creation necessitates having a place for users to view and manage their patterns. WordPress 6.3 will also include a first pass at <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/51078\">a Pattern Library inside the Site Editor</a>, which will include both patterns and template parts.

There&#8217;s no way to tell that those blocks originated from a pattern, especially since they can be edited to no longer resemble the source pattern.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Partially synced mode is different. When a pattern that&#8217;s partially synced is inserted, it retains a reference to the source pattern. The blocks within the pattern are locked so that they cannot be removed or reordered and new blocks cannot be inserted (this is called&nbsp;<code>contentOnly</code>&nbsp;locking). Only specific parts of the pattern considered &#8216;content&#8217; can be edited (denoted by adding&nbsp;<code>__experimentalRole: \'content\'</code>&nbsp;to a block&#8217;s definition).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When the source pattern is updated, all instances of blocks that reference the source pattern are updated too (much like a reusable block), but the&nbsp;<code>content</code>&nbsp;values the user entered are retained. The best way to think of this is that the user can update the design of a pattern, but doesn&#8217;t lose content that exists in templates and posts.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>This concept will not make it into the upcoming version of WordPress, as contributors are still discussing one of many complex implementations, but it offers a glimpse of what might be more granular control coming to patterns in the future. Partially synced patterns would bring distinct benefits to many CMS and content design use cases where clients may be editing content. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I am a site developer for an agency, and am actively making sites for clients using Gutenberg every day,&#8221; Eric Michel said. &#8220;Probably our biggest pain point right now is that the editor does not handle types of content that are mostly standardized with small content customizations per post &#8211; things like contact directories, majors at a university, products in a catalog.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;For us, the absolute dream scenario is what you are proposing, except with the inclusion of the ability to alter the primary template and have all of the pages that use that template automatically change as well.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/discussions/50456\">discussion</a> on making partially synced patterns possible continues in search of an implementation that will ensure users don&#8217;t modify the patterns in ways that destroy the ability to display the retained content. WordPress 6.3 will ship with synced and non-synced pattern options, and partially synced patterns may land further down the road in a future release.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 27 Jun 2023 02:11:22 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:25;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:128:\"Gutenberg Times: Reusable Blocks are Patterns too, Style Book, Block Handbook Navigator and Command Center—Weekend Edition 258\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/?p=24511\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:135:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/reusable-blocks-are-patterns-too-style-book-block-handbook-navigator-and-command-center-weekend-edition-258/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:15512:\"<p>Howdy, </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s been a more quiet week. Many people have been working hard to get the latest features into the next Gutenberg release, so they can also be merged with WordPress 6.3. If you want to start testing, the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/releases/tag/untagged-c35f7346f2e514d1fedb\">Gutenberg 16.1 RC is available here</a>. The changelog is massive. Next week, Tammie Lister will be going over this with me when we record the next Gutenberg Changelog. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Friday, I&#8217;ll hope on a train to Leipzig and give a presentation to the attendees of the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-confirms-8-pilot-events-to-launch-the-next-generation-of-wordcamps-in-2023\">back-to-the-roots, no frills WordCamp</a>. Added thrill for me: it&#8217;s my first time presenting in German about technology. Oy. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next week is also WordPress 6.3 Beta 1 release. Get ready for testing and filing bug reports! The best way to learn what will be in 6.3 is by using the beta version and heed the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/2023/06/07/fse-program-testing-call-24-momery-makeover/\">Testing Call #24: Momery Makeover</a>.

Be aware that&#8217;s only the working title and contributors discuss renaming it. <strong>Sarah Gooding</strong> reports on the discussion <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-contributors-discuss-renaming-command-center-tool\"><strong>WordPress Contributors Discuss Renaming Command Center Tool</strong></a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"reusable\">Reusable blocks are now called Patterns</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Creating patterns using the block editor has been one of the most requested features since Patterns have been available and since the release of the Pattern directory on WordPress.org in Summer of 2021.  It&#8217;s now coming to the editor in WordPress 6.3 version. It uses the same workflow as creating reusable blocks. To remind you: create a collection of blocks, group them, and use the 3-dot menu &#8220;Create reusable Block&#8221; except it now says &#8220;Create custom pattern&#8221;. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Turns out Patterns and Reusable blocks are cut almost from the same cloth. The only difference is that the change to a reusable block synchs over all the instances the block has been used, hence the new name &#8220;synched pattern&#8221;.  There is now a toggle switch to &#8220;Keep all pattern instances in sync&#8221; or not. This is the first iteration: the name change and the creation workflow. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To re-use the pattern, you find them in different places, though. Synched patterns are listed in the list of Blocks in the Inserter and available via slash &#8220;/&#8221; command. Unsynched patterns are in a new Pattern category = Custom Patterns in the Patterns Tab in the big blue button inserter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many users, and I might be one of them, who find patterns, should also be at least partially sync-able. That feature is planned to come to the block editor after WordPress 6.3 is released. It will take a few more thoughts on how to separate the various pieces. You might want to synch the design but not the words, or styles but not the images. The headings but not the links. And immediately you see that this can be quite complicated. So, it might take some more time. You can read up on the genesis of this new feature in the PR <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/51144\">Reusable blocks: Rename to &#8216;Patterns&#8217; and add option to also add a non-synced Pattern.

Once enabled, it notifies users if a vulnerability is found and suggests actions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Really Simple SSL mirrors the free database with its own instance to secure stability and deliverability, but of course provides the origin database with an API to enrich, or improve its current data,&#8221; Really Simple Plugins developer Aert Hulsebos said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new vulnerability detection feature is not enabled by default, so users will need to <a href=\"https://really-simple-ssl.com/instructions/about-vulnerabilities/\">enable it in the settings</a>. A modal will pop up where users can configure their notifications and run the first scan.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>When emailed about a vulnerability users can manually respond with an action or set the plugin to automatically force an update (when available) after 24 hours of no response. There are other automated actions the plugin can take based on how users configure the Measures section of the settings.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>For the past several years Really Simple SSL has been providing SSL certificate configuration and installation via Let&#8217;s Encrypt as a first pass at securing WordPress sites. To finance this for the free users, the plugin also has a Pro version that handles Security Headers, such as Content Security Policies, which are highly complex for most and not easily configured.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We figured that with our reach we could impact security on the web as a whole, by adding features in order of impact on security,&#8221; Hulsebos said. &#8220;So vulnerabilities, after hardening features specific to WordPress, was next. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The nature of our partnership with Javier and WP Vulnerability is sponsoring the efforts of WP Vulnerability and appointing a security consultant ourselves to this open-source effort to improve, and moderate the open-source database daily. WP Vulnerability does not compensate us, nor does it have a stake in Really Simple SSL.

At first there was an emphasis on getting the community to contribute to the resource but the directory has now passed more than 1,500 patterns. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contributors are making changes to provide a more curated experience ahead of the inclusion of <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/44611\">a new Pattern Directory Explorer</a> that is still in progress. A recent <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2023/06/09/new-curation-filter-in-pattern-directory/\">update</a> to the Pattern Directory alters the homepage and category pages to show curated patterns by default, a change that has been a bit confusing for some when returning to the directory. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Anyone know where all the block patterns have gone on <a href=\"https://t.co/LpzR9lR7uc\">https://t.co/LpzR9lR7uc</a> ? <a href=\"https://t.co/Dt9EK7Ssik\">https://t.co/Dt9EK7Ssik</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/gutenberg?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#gutenberg</a></p>&mdash; Jamie Pootlepress &#8211; YouTuber and WP Plugin builder (@pootlepress) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pootlepress/status/1671881903593623556?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 22, 2023</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>The curated patterns are those by WordPress.org &#8211; the core bundled patterns. Community-contributed patterns are available as a filter in the dropdown of the directory&#8217;s menu.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>There are only 46 core patterns, so some category pages tend to look a little sparse and far less colorful than when community patterns are selected. At the moment, having curated patterns display by default does not offer the best experience for users coming to browse, as Pootlepress founder Jamie Marsland pointed out on Twitter. Automattic-sponsored contributor Rich Tabor responded that there is still more work to be done on providing a better curated experience in the Pattern Directory. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The top ones are the best.

Users on the Free plan are now able to use monetization features without upgrading. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the past, WordPress.com users who wanted to earn money on their websites by collecting donations, creating a newsletter, or selling items or subscriptions, had to be on one of the paid plans. These <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/support/monetize-your-site/\">monetization features</a> are now available to all users on all tiers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fee structure varies, based on the user&#8217;s plan.  Transaction fees are the highest for Free users at 10%, but it gives creators the opportunity to see if they can make money without it costing anything upfront. Commerce plan users ($70/month or $45/month billed annually) don&#8217;t pay any transaction fees. Stripe also collects 2.9% + US$0.30 for each payment made to a Stripe account in the US.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<table><tbody><tr><td><strong>WordPress.com Plan</strong></td><td><strong>Payment Fees</strong></td></tr><tr><td>WordPress.com Commerce</td><td>0%</td></tr><tr><td>WordPress.com Business</td><td>2%</td></tr><tr><td>WordPress.com Premium</td><td>4%</td></tr><tr><td>WordPress.com Personal</td><td>8%</td></tr><tr><td>WordPress.com Free</td><td>10%</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n\n\n<p>Self-hosted WordPress users already have many free plugin options to monetize theirs sites but with that comes the requirement of knowing how to maintain and update their own sites. WordPress.com&#8217;s offering is targeted at creators who just want to get started making money online. The company is inching closer to being a one-stop shop for websites, especially as it <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/blog/2023/06/21/how-to-transfer-your-domain-to-wordpresscom/\">makes a play for former Google Domains customers</a> who are looking for somewhere to host domains after theirs were sold to Squarespace.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s important to note that creating a full-featured online store is still restricted to Business and Commerce plans. Using <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/support/pay-with-paypal/\">Pay with PayPal</a> to accept credit and debit card payments via PayPal is also only available via an upgraded plan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress.com&#8217;s <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/pricing/\">pricing</a> page has not yet been updated to reflect monetization features as being free &#8211; i.e. the Personal plan still lists paid subscribers and premium content gating as an upgrade. It&#8217;s possible the team hasn&#8217;t edited that page yet or this may be another pricing experiment. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Expanding the availability of monetization features is likely to be received as a positive change, since users are not losing any features that were previously free. Instead, they have the opportunity to see if they can monetize and then adjust their plans based on their comfort level with the transaction fees extracted.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 22 Jun 2023 22:58:38 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:29;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:57:\"WPTavern: Gravatar Adds New Payment Features for Profiles\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=146134\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"https://wptavern.com/gravatar-adds-new-payment-features-for-profiles\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3203:\"<p>Up until yesterday, the Gravatar (Globally Recognized Avatar) blog lay dormant for nine years, the <a href=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/2014/07/23/something-funny-happened/\">last post</a> chronicling how the team set out to create a Gravatar app that somehow &#8220;<a href=\"https://wptavern.com/automattics-planned-gravatar-app-morphs-into-a-selfies-app-for-android\">morphed into a Selfies app</a>.&#8221; Communication went silent after that, although the Twitter account posted occasionally.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The service has pivoted to become &#8220;a personal digital business card&#8221; where users can link to various apps and websites that help to establish their identities online. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gravatar announced this week that it has <a href=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/2023/06/21/new-on-gravatar-collect-payments-on-the-go/\">launched new payment features for profiles</a>.

In this episode, they discuss the importance of finding personal fulfillment, embracing the journey, and enjoying the process of pursuing hobbies and personal projects. They encourage everyone to reevaluate their definition of success and find meaning in the act of creation while also cherishing the connections and collaborations that come along the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Top Takeaways:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Redefining Success and Goals</strong>: The idea of reevaluating one&#8217;s definition of success. Instead of solely focusing on financial gain or external measures, there is a shift towards valuing the impact and value brought to others through one&#8217;s work or personal projects. Success is viewed as creating something meaningful that brings joy or usefulness to users rather than solely pursuing monetary goals.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Importance of Collaboration and Connection</strong>: The value of collaboration and building connections with like-minded individuals. The joy derived from hobbies or personal projects can be enhanced by sharing experiences, exchanging ideas, and working together with others. Building lasting friendships and relationships through shared interests can be a source of support and fulfillment.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Embracing the Process and Finding Fulfillment in the Journey</strong>: The importance of enjoying the process and finding fulfillment in the act of creating or working on something rather than solely focusing on the end result. The journey itself, the learning, the challenges, and the growth that occur along the way can be sources of joy and satisfaction. It&#8217;s about finding meaning and enjoyment in the present moment rather than solely fixating on the outcome.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading eplus-wrapper\" id=\"h-mentioned-in-the-show\"><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f517.png\" alt=\"🔗\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> Mentioned in the show:</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://crop.express/\">Crop.Express</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://balsamiq.com/\">Balsamiq</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/\">Meetup.com</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://slack.com/trials?remote_promo=f4d95f0b&d=7013y000002pzGQAAY&nc=7013y000002q165AAA&utm_source=google&utm_medium=paid_search&utm_campaign=ppc_google_amer_en_brand_selfserve_discount&utm_content=slack-pg-ss-all-us-brand_7013y000002pzGQAAY&utm_term=Slack_Exact_._slack_._e_._c_._611662283461&gad=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwv8qkBhAnEiwAkY-ahrvtUlvMruMS8SCCYA3MqgkRfViYepC5CP2yCdrFJkc4X3xdPxz3sxoCzVcQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds\">Slack</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.com/\">WordPress</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/\">Twitter</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/\">Instagram</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading eplus-wrapper\" id=\"h-you-can-follow-post-status-and-our-guests-on-twitter\"><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f426.png\" alt=\"🐦\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> You can follow Post Status and our guests on Twitter:</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"eplus-wrapper\">\n<li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/coreymaass\">Corey Maass</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/corymiller303\">Cory Miller</a> (CEO, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/post_status\">Post Status</a>)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/lemonadecode\">Olivia Bisset</a> (Intern, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/post_status\">Post Status</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"eplus-wrapper has-background\">The <strong>Post Status Draft</strong> podcast is geared toward WordPress professionals, with interviews, news, and deep analysis. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f4dd.png\" alt=\"📝\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /><br /><br /><a href=\"https://poststatus.com/category/post-status-podcasts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Browse our archives</a>, and don’t forget to subscribe via <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/post-status-draft-wordpress/id976403008\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">iTunes</a>, <a href=\"https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5zaW1wbGVjYXN0LmNvbS8ySkU5c2M4UA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Google Podcasts</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/PostStatus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">YouTube</a>, <a href=\"http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/krogsgard/post-status-draft-wordpress-podcast\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Stitcher</a>, <a href=\"https://wordpress-post-status-draft-podcast.simplecast.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Simplecast</a>, or <a href=\"https://feeds.simplecast.com/2JE9sc8P\">RSS</a>. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f3a7.png\" alt=\"🎧\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading eplus-wrapper\" id=\"h-transcript\">Transcript</h2>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Session 18 Corey &amp; Cory Launch a WordPress Product Live</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>C&amp;C 18</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:00] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> And don&#8217;t forget to record this time. Yeah, no.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:23] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Excellent. All right everybody. Welcome back to Corey and Cordy launching a pro WordPress product live session 18. And we&#8217;ve had, we were just kind of in prep for this real quick, just talking about a little of the things that&#8217;s been going on in our lives. It&#8217;s always fun to talk real life with a great person like Corey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, um, this time we&#8217;re just gonna kind of talk about catching up. We&#8217;ve been out kind of the last two, maybe three weeks I wanna say. Yep. And, um, I have been on, uh, uh, last week I was at CLOUDFEST in Austin for post status. Then we extended and went on a Epic Clark w Griswold type. Um, Road trip. Got to see Carlsbad Caverns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and, and they were closed. Yes. No, dead ants on the roof of the minivan. When we did render vans, I had to go Griswold South. Um, but I know you&#8217;ve had things going on too, so, um, that&#8217;s a little snippet for me just trying to kinda get things a little bit better sane for me work-wise. And, um, I think that&#8217;s in preparation for the.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Real conversation here, but um, you wanna Yeah. Updates on what you&#8217;ve been&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:36] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> up to. Yeah. And on my end, so it&#8217;s, I&#8217;ve, so I&#8217;ve got, you know, one, one main client and, uh, I have a monthly. They, they ask me to stay within a window of, of how much I work and what, uh, what I actually like about that is I tend to work a little less the beginning of the month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and then, uh, which lets me work on side projects or lets me work on the house or whatever. Uh, Um, and then towards the end of the month, you know, the days get longer to make sure I hit my quota, um, and maximize my budget. But, um, so at the beginning of the month I wound up helping my dad drive from South Carolina up to Maine, um, which is a really fun road trip with dad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, you know, and of course the, the client website goes down when I&#8217;m the farthest from my computer. Uh, you know, sitting at a restaurant in, uh, Fredericksburg, Virginia, if you ever have the opportunity, it&#8217;s a beautiful little place to stop. Um, but anyway, and then you can probably hear from my voice. I think last week I begged off because I was sick as a dog.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, And it&#8217;s funny, it actually, you&#8217;re like, oh, it&#8217;s been I think two, three weeks and I&#8217;m like, it feels like it&#8217;s been months. Cuz I spent at least, uh, a few days last week. Literally just in bed in a NyQuil haze, you know? So it felt like weeks went by and, um, you know, and then you come out of that and you&#8217;ve gotta scramble to make up work and, um, get caught up on life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, um, and then for me time, um, Always means house projects. So we&#8217;ve built another, uh, 11 times eight. So 88 feet of fencing. No. And then we turn a corner, so about 120 feet of fencing, stockade, fencing, cuz we&#8217;re getting a new foster dog. Um, and uh, so setting up a room for him and anyway, yeah, it just gets crazy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, uh, and so I think you and I touched. Space briefly last week and, and said, okay, so, you know, that&#8217;s fine. We missed a week or two. Let&#8217;s, let&#8217;s start, um, moving forward. I was like, all right, you know, I&#8217;m still working on a review of, uh, the product. I&#8217;ll get you a new version for post status. I don&#8217;t think you heard from me until nine minutes ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, that never happened. So, yeah. You know, but it&#8217;s like, and I hate to. It, it&#8217;s easy to fall into like, well, it&#8217;s not out yet, so it, you know, there are no expectations other than our own. Yeah. Which is true. Um, you know, but it&#8217;s also like, I mean, this is, this is part of why we do this, right? Like, yeah. We&#8217;re, we&#8217;re at least part of our, our aspirations is, is freedom, uh, to make our own choices, to manage our own hours, to work on what we wanna work on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, which also means, I mean, family comes first and health comes first, and Yeah. You know, and, and paying clients come first when you&#8217;re at this stage. So, you know, these are just things we have to juggle and, and keep trying to make progress. I mean, it says everything to me that. You and I at least are like, okay, let&#8217;s keep talking once a week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where are we at? You know? And, and cuz I have other people who I&#8217;ve worked with who many, many other people who, who ghost or who just wanna stop. There&#8217;s, there&#8217;s inherently so much shame in all of it that the moment they miss a day or a deadline or don&#8217;t hit the mark in some fashion, don&#8217;t want to talk about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, I have friends who we&#8217;ve been talking about, Collaborating for years talking about like music or art or whatever. And, and now we, we, we&#8217;ve gone months where we&#8217;ll talk every week or every month, you know, how are you, how are the kids, da, da da. And we literally won&#8217;t, we won&#8217;t talk about the subject now because there&#8217;s, you know, because we didn&#8217;t, one of us didn&#8217;t move forward with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s shame associated with it, so, you know. Definitely none of it&#8217;s that important, you know?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:56] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Yeah, exactly. Like we started with really good intentions and openness. Um, what it occurs to me is just kinda your references back to music and bands and stuff is like, I&#8217;ve not, I, I played an instrument when I was in like middle school, but I&#8217;ve not been in a band, but it&#8217;s occurs to me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s like, it seems like that you&#8217;re, mm-hmm. Stru, you know, struggling to kinda get something going. And then there&#8217;s seasons of life that happened. Um, this, this stage of my life and my career, I really see more of the seasonal aspects of life. Yeah. Better than I ever have. And you go. You know, just things you don&#8217;t, you can&#8217;t anticipate, or if you tried to, you&#8217;d have another set of problems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, um, it&#8217;s just like you said, like we&#8217;ve got other priorities, but, uh, it&#8217;s important for us to keep talking. I, I think too, when I think about entrepreneurship, I think there&#8217;s like part real hard work just doing things, trying to do it consistently, getting things out there, getting the next thing, and then there&#8217;s this bigger part.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which is, maybe somebody would&#8217;ve called it luck, you know? But it is like magic. You know? You stay around doing something. Maybe bands operate like this, I don&#8217;t know, but like you, you got enough interest, you know something&#8217;s there, you just haven&#8217;t figured it out yet. And then a magical moment, and I say magic cuz it&#8217;s like oftentimes in my career, specifically my professional career as an entrepreneur couldn&#8217;t have planned those things, man.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They just happened, you know? Um, however, I might have tried to take credit for them. They just happened and it&#8217;s like the reading I&#8217;ve been and work I&#8217;ve been doing too personally is like creativity. You don&#8217;t control creativity. Those really magical moments we&#8217;re talking about, they kind of blossom out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there was somebody I was just like, well, Anna, who runs feeder bars, Lindsay and her have been friends for a decade, you know? Anna tried so many things over the years, so many things, and then Vita Bars was the spark, the magic that made it happen. Mm-hmm. Now, now she&#8217;s full-time with it and she&#8217;s got employees and all that kind of stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So like all that time it&#8217;s kinda like learning the piano. People go, oh, you&#8217;re at the piano. You&#8217;re doing this beautiful thing at the wedding, or whatever it is. They don&#8217;t think about all those years spent. Right. You know, in the practice of it, and it&#8217;s kinda like that moment too. It&#8217;s like, I&#8217;m dribbing for a second, but do enough things to get to a moment that, that you probably didn&#8217;t plan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think most of us, at least the entrepreneurs I know would say. Yep. That&#8217;s about it. Absolutely. Yeah. However, we like to think we control it and plan it. We don&#8217;t.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:59] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> And there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s time. Sometimes you, you, you ha you just have to let time go by. It&#8217;s like, in music, it&#8217;s one of the hardest things I&#8217;ve, I&#8217;ve had to learn.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s like for years I made music and put out music, made music, and put out music. And then I actually started writing music that people were like, oh, this is a summertime song. It&#8217;s the end of the summer. We&#8217;re not gonna put it out now. That&#8217;d be dumb. So we&#8217;re gonna sit on it and you, and it&#8217;s like in actual pop music, you can find out that there, there were pop songs, but huge, huge hits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And in our minds, you know, you&#8217;re picturing, you know, Taylor Swift yesterday was in the, in the recording studio and then today you&#8217;re hearing the song cuz that&#8217;s cuz music can be live. Um, and in this day and age, sometimes that&#8217;s true and it&#8217;s a truer than it used to be. It used to be that, you know, a band would go into a studio and produce an album and it would take months and yada yada, you know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But a lot of the times thing, tunes or tracks or albums are actually held back. To try to be released strategically. It&#8217;s like big movies that sit on shelves for, you know, years potentially, because they&#8217;re like, this is a Christmas day blockbuster, we&#8217;re not gonna release, you know, or a summertime when all the kids are outta school type of movie.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, we&#8217;re not gonna release it on the second day of school on a Tuesday. That&#8217;s dumb, you know? Um, but we don&#8217;t, we don&#8217;t really think about that, but, There&#8217;s sometimes there&#8217;s strategic reasons and sometimes like this where it&#8217;s like, I&#8217;m a lot better about it than I used to be, especially since, um, years ago now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So for a while I tried to make music an actual career or second career, um, and it really broke my heart. And so I stepped away from it for a while, and then when I was getting back into it, this is where having an amazing spouse is worth everything. Lindsay and I sat down, my Lindsay spelled with an A, sat down and, and she&#8217;s like, okay, so you, you know, you wanna get back into music.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Great. Like, how do we, how does it not break your heart again? And one of the things that, that. Came outta that conversation was me being able to articulate like, okay, I&#8217;m not taking it as seriously this time, it&#8217;s a hobby. Mm-hmm. And, and so suddenly a lot of things changed. One, you know, I couldn&#8217;t just go out and, and buy new instruments or, you know, throw money at it the way I used to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure. But it also meant that like I could work on, like, I have found that I make a lot of. Music in the fall and then tend to not make any music, but it, but a lot of that music that I finish, I can like leak out again, a track a month or I can wait until summertime and put it out or whatever. And so it&#8217;s like I&#8217;ve got these big waves rather than it just being, you know, picturing this straight line of productivity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and I think it, that kind of goes for this, this stuff too, like, This stuff. Uh, entrepreneurship side hustles. They&#8217;re, they&#8217;re side hustles. And for a long time I, I was like, I want this to be a day job. Still would love it. I&#8217;d still love my own product to be my primary focus. Then it&#8217;s a job that&#8217;s very different, right from, um, side, side hustles, um, ideas, putting out little apps, little ideas, um, little products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, um, so. And so it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s picking things up, putting things down, um, and, and these days being okay with, again, letting some time go by or occasionally changing priorities even for a, a little while. Um, cuz there was a time when. I remember one time in particular that I was like, I was in between paying client gigs and came up with an idea [00:13:00] for an app and was like, okay, I&#8217;ve gotta crank this out and then it&#8217;s also gotta make money.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it was like the dumbest little idea. I won&#8217;t even share it, I&#8217;m embarrassed. Um, but it was like, it was an app that nobody wanted, you know? It solved a problem that nobody had. It was just an idea. But I remember like, Going, this is the first time where I, I, it has to make money. And I was like, it&#8217;s never gonna make money.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, and I&#8217;m, so, I&#8217;m putting myself in danger here. That&#8217;s dumb. You know? Um, and that&#8217;s not to say that there aren&#8217;t entrepreneurial journeys. With VC capital or, you know, we&#8217;ve gotta double down and, and make this our full-time gig and all that stuff. But it&#8217;s like, at least for me, I find often that I&#8217;m, if I&#8217;m making decisions from a position of desperation, of, of need.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That I&#8217;m not gonna make the best decision, you know, cuz my priorities, I can&#8217;t have any, I can&#8217;t have proper perspective on it. So, stepping back for a few weeks, honestly, what I look forward to is going back into my code, realizing that I did everything wrong and cleaning it up and then it&#8217;s a better product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, and you know, are we the worst off for having missed a few weeks? Maybe. Who can say nothing&#8217;s obvious? Um, you know, but again, you know, just trying to keep moving forward with it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:19] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> I think it&#8217;s like when we&#8217;re thinking about bands and hit music or products and entrepreneurs think about, you know, with or, and Anna and yours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My experience in this is like, If there&#8217;s enough of a fire to keep it going. Mm-hmm. You know, just enough. It doesn&#8217;t have to be a bonfire. There&#8217;ll be times of that for sure, but, but then mostly it&#8217;s probably just. Sometimes a little candle, sometimes just a little mini campfire. But if there&#8217;s enough in fuel in there that there&#8217;s something here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think time is on your, like you said, as time goes by, time is on your side because yeah, it&#8217;s only a matter of time where th where things kinda move and shift and the, the market, the world where you&#8217;re like that. Some of the classic stories, the person I&#8217;m thinking of, I think it&#8217;s a product company and how it came out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s just a recent example, but the classic ones were in Founders at Work where you almost stumbled into, backed into what became the hit thing. But you couldn&#8217;t have kind of planned that. Right. Um, where you were just keeping on a path enough, knew something was here, didn&#8217;t thought you had a beat on it a couple of times, and then just really it was just.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fire was stoked long enough where something did really hit and it became this, it, it became its own thing, I guess. Yeah. Lot of the, and I&#8217;m not, go ahead. A lot of the entrepreneurial stories I hear, they aren&#8217;t like the VC route. We saw a big market and we went after and we got a big money. Uh, that&#8217;s a, that&#8217;s an outlier I think, um, for the, Millions of us, the rest of us, I think it&#8217;s mostly backing into something, staying around long enough to find the opportunity that really fits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:09] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Yeah. Chipping away at it, having, having fun with it, working around real life needs, family, money, mortgages, healthcare, you know, that kind of stuff. And it&#8217;s like, and that&#8217;s kind of the difference. Like I, I have friends who I. Are, have always wanted to do something. And I&#8217;m like, so outside of their job and, and so I&#8217;m like, so do something, you know, talking art, music, entrepreneurship, whatever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s like you just, you, you, you have it in you or you don&#8217;t is one aspect and then the timing is right. Where it&#8217;s like you have that drive and you look around and you&#8217;re like, okay, right now I&#8217;ve got a couple hours a day where I&#8217;ve got. Whatever commitment you need, you know, to work at it. And so, um, and I think you and I also, I mean this is, this is the warm and fuzzy moment, but it&#8217;s like you and I also I think, have looked for an opportunity to work together for a long time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s like we will continue to be friends and, you know, hopeful partners in something kind of always, you know. Yep. Um, I do have to say that. We have to keep the fire burning at least long enough to, so that I get to rock the swag at WordCamp us. That&#8217;s true. These are the, these are the real important things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:40] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Um, yeah, a absolutely. I know. Um, no, and I think that&#8217;s the other part on, down to this is, you know, at the base I enjoy our conversations. It it, it&#8217;s this hot, crazy hobby we might have of. Seeing what&#8217;s out there, seen, seeing something following the path down it. And, uh, I still believe in the product. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, but it&#8217;s funny, it&#8217;s like I believe in the product, but I also believe in the path that might lead to something else. Yeah. Because, I mean, well, we&#8217;re on our second iteration of a product. Like, not even same product, there&#8217;s similarities. Mm-hmm. But like, we went down this path to here and I think it just adds to the ongoing conversation that we&#8217;re having is something&#8217;s gonna happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. And then there&#8217;s a flat, simple, practical byproduct. All of this is that we&#8217;re having a conversation live and sharing our philosophies, sharing our thoughts, sharing our actions, um, all these things that has another byproduct that could lead us in another direction altogether, which is good. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. You just say from a professional opportunity standpoint,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:53] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> right, exactly. I mean, it&#8217;s the part, being part of the same network overlapping concentric circles. Um, And, uh, and kinda seeing what comes out of it. Cuz the other, I think the other thing I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m thinking in from the perspective of somebody who&#8217;s listening, who&#8217;s like, right, you, you know, you are both established.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You have, you know, other income streams or you&#8217;ve got your networks, you&#8217;ve, you know, and, and you&#8217;re also putting a product out there. Like, I still see people on entrepreneurial forums that are like, you know, somebody&#8217;s gonna steal my idea. And, and we have gone the other direction and, and obviously we&#8217;re not the first, but, um, of, you know, just brazenly putting it out there and taking our sweet time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s be honest. Like if we were other people, if we had venture capital, if we, you know, Didn&#8217;t have, you know, responsibilities and mortgages and things like we&#8217;d eat ramen and we&#8217;d have cranked this thing out years, uh, months ago. And, um, and there&#8217;s absolutely the chance that somebody listens and goes, oh, that&#8217;s a great idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, and comes in and, and, Steals it and releases it before we do. Um, you know, but it&#8217;s still, like you just said, it&#8217;s all part of the journey. We&#8217;re going to put our own twist on it. We&#8217;re going to put our own experience on it and, uh, and continue to iterate on the project, the product too. So when the product does come out, like it&#8217;s very much ours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it might overlap with other people&#8217;s, but frankly it already will. Like, that&#8217;s the nature of. Pretty much any product. There&#8217;s no, there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s really, you know, almost nothing that hasn&#8217;t been invented. Um, and I also, another, uh, thread I saw recently again on, um, I think it was Reddit, one of the entrepreneurial ride along, or, or one of those subreddits, um, That people were concerned about not having an idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And everybody else was like, just you, you don&#8217;t, you know, okay, don&#8217;t, don&#8217;t steal an idea and reproduce it. Like that&#8217;s boring. But you know, if you can build the better mousetrap, if you can build the better to-do list, if you can build the better time tracking app, uh, you know, whatever, do it. Like, that&#8217;s how most.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Competition starts as, as these pretty subtle little differences. Um, and then you listen to your users, you listen to your own gut, and you end up di I feel like you end up diverging more and more and more. Um, you know, and or you&#8217;ve got, you&#8217;ve got a network that, that you can tap into that existing client or existing products can&#8217;t or whatever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, um, You know, it&#8217;s all, I guess I, these days I view it, I view it as kind of as a game, which is more flippant than it probably sounds, but it&#8217;s like you&#8217;re wheeling and dealing, but there&#8217;s times when you win and there&#8217;s times when you lose. God. I&#8217;m being very metaphorical here, but, um, you know, but it&#8217;s the, the.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I view it as an ebb and flow, which is, uh, again, I think for me the, the way that I had to phrase it a while ago was like, this is a hobby. And, uh, and so it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s meant to be fun. Um, and that isn&#8217;t to say that everything we do has to be fun cuz, and, and, or that I don&#8217;t take it seriously, but, um, but it gives you, I think, a little more perspective.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You don&#8217;t have, I don&#8217;t, I don&#8217;t have board members that I have to, or, you know, or stockholders that I have to appease. Um, And I don&#8217;t have, uh, you know, I don&#8217;t have to burn the, the, the candle at both ends, um, to make ends meet if there&#8217;s a bug. And I&#8217;ve got users that are depending on me, that happens with my apps or my plugins once in a while, but it&#8217;s honestly like once in a while.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s fun. I don&#8217;t wanna do it all the time, but it&#8217;s like, oh, I&#8217;ve gotta do a little hackathon and, and you know, figure this out until 2:00 AM cuz a bunch of people are depending on me. That&#8217;s fun too, you know? So,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:45] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Yeah. It occurs to me it&#8217;s really a low pressure and stress for us, which is what we both need.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right. Um, having a little bit more, I mean, I guess that&#8217;s the definition of a hobby, right? You know, enjoyment without the stress and pressure. Yeah. When it switches from hobby. Oftentimes it counts with stress and pressure. Yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:08] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Well, and and it&#8217;s interesting cuz like I, I worked at startups, you know, it&#8217;s like I&#8217;ve done, I&#8217;ve done a lot of work in WordPress, um, and there&#8217;s been a lot of overlap.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I also, for a long time specifically was working for and with and at startups, um, of different natures. Um, and some of it was WordPress work and some of it was not. But there, there, and I was in New York City for a long, long time, um, so-called Silicon Alley. Um, during the WeWork stuff, I think I&#8217;ve mentioned that before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can actually see me in the WeWork movie and, um, and all that. And I was surrounded by people who were hustling all the hustlers and, and all that stuff. And it&#8217;s like, Most people were chipping away. I mean, almost like, like almost anything. It&#8217;s a, everything&#8217;s a bell curve, right? So most of the people on the bell curve were just chipping away, you know, and they weren&#8217;t burning themselves out, but they weren&#8217;t also only working a day a week or something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you had people who were working very, very hard. And you did have people who were there just for the lifestyle and honestly spent all day just playing ping pong. Um, and were there for the beer kegs, you know? Um, But working at different startups, like I&#8217;ve worked at startups where it was all hustle, hustle, hustle, and we&#8217;ve gotta put in long hours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, um, and I, I found that I got out of those pretty quickly in part because I would, would burn out. Um, and I think it would be different if I had been in charge. Um, but like the one main startup where I was CTO was. Um, I think there&#8217;s a cultural difference here. Um, but it was in Nashville. It wasn&#8217;t in New York.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there&#8217;s, um, there two things were different. We were not in the hustle bustle of New York City. Nashville&#8217;s a little more easygoing. Um, but also we were generally all, you know, in our thirties and older, we weren&#8217;t all a type. Hustler entrepreneurs. Um, and then, uh, stereotypically, uh, down south you&#8217;ve got family values are, uh, or at least the family itself is prioritized higher.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so we, there, we absolutely put in some long days, but for the most part it was. A priority of the founder and subsequently everybody else on the team that, you know, you wouldn&#8217;t, if it could be done tomorrow, if it was five or six o&#8217;clock, then fine. Do it tomorrow. You know, keep chipping away, make good progress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, um, you know, but you didn&#8217;t, we didn&#8217;t have to burn ourselves out. Uh, we weren&#8217;t gonna really get anywhere by burning ourselves out. And, and we did just fine till we ran outta money, which happens with startups. Um, you know, but it, but it doesn&#8217;t, it doesn&#8217;t always have to be that crazy atmosphere. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I, I&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:02] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> can&#8217;t help but think there&#8217;s a shift going on globally too, with work.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:07] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Um, what, sorry, what, what was it like at, like, ithe or, you know, some of the, the bigger places you&#8217;ve worked?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:13] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> The biggest place I have been be beyond like liquid web would be, um, I was at a seminary and I think there was 150, 200 people employed by the seminary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe that it&#8217;s too much. No, I actually, there&#8217;s a hundred, 150, um, that, that was just a very academic setting, so it was money, always money. So, Um, I loved it cause it was a learning stuff, but as far as like in the past, um, you know, I worked at newspapers, so it was always deadline. I think it was more startup, you know?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Very much startup. Except every day we were launching a new product.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:58] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> That&#8217;s, that&#8217;s insane.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:00] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Which I think is why I probably liked entrepreneurship is just the deadlines and product is, it was so fulfilling to come. At the end of the day. But as far as values and stuff goes, I think I learned more in my leadership from what the not to do what I didn&#8217;t like, the obsession with whatever the goal was at the expense of people and just realistically, like what are we expecting people to do?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, I could, my truck. Get it all, get it up to 150 miles per hour and get into the red line, then it&#8217;s eventually gonna break. And I don&#8217;t think you can do that. We try to do that with people. Um, but I took a lot of those lessons leadership wise. I had, um, probably some things I go, I&#8217;m not gonna do that ever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My last job before I started iThemes, um, I worked for a really amazing pastor. The one that kind of refreshed my optimism that. There could be one who at the time, the way I understood the Bible was be just a shepherd. You know? Um, he was really awesome. I really, I, I took his archive as a leader into, into I themes or eventually when we grew on our team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you&#8217;re right, the first, first couple years, um, it was just fun and new. It was creating stuff. With hopes and dreams and thoughts and ideas and, uh, it was messy. Um, it was messy, but we got to do some cool stuff. We did like create an office that eventually grew to about 5,000 square feet and got to, like, my dad actually drove up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From about two hours from where he lives from us and came and helped me, helped us demolish some of the walls that were up at this place. Cause we wanted more of that bigger open thing and we went to IKEA and get all the tables. And I think about all that initial time, very romantically, very affectionately, because it was just, we didn&#8217;t all know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We didn&#8217;t know what we were doing. I sure as hell didn&#8217;t know what I was doing, but it was fun creating something that. What would our expression look like? And so I would say for the first three years it was just kinda hanging on and having fun with, yeah, doing some real stuff. Um, there was electricity in the air and uh, with a whole set of problems that developed out of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then I think when we hit about a million in revenue, I couldn&#8217;t manage the team by myself. Um, we were up to at least 10 people by that time and. I think things got more serious and probably professional, um, in the sense of, okay, you know, we, we had health insurance probably I think our first year. As soon as we hired the first couple employees we needed to get health insurance type of thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And uh, but I think that year something was different is like, we&#8217;ve got something here. Yeah. Lining in the bottle. Let&#8217;s figure out how to protect it, grow it. Maintain it. And um, and so we needed some of the structure in there. Um, my value as leader though, was always, like, I did a talk early on. I was like, I wanted to build a tree house.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wanted to have a tree house, and I wanted to invite all these cool people to play with me in the tree house. That&#8217;s what it was the first couple years. And, and some really good stuff came out of that. Um, you know, we didn&#8217;t fall out of the tree house and break her arm. Um, mostly, and then it was, it was shifting of like, holy crap, like look at this thing, we gotta figure out that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, but when it really serious was toward the end when it was like, oh, there was more children of our employees than there were employees, and that was responsibility barrier. And then it&#8217;s like, house gets a little serious, you know? Yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:07] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> That&#8217;s interesting. Um,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:11] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> so yeah, I&#8217;m. I look back at that time very fondly and nostalgically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, cuz I remember it was toward the end of the year. No, it was after the first of the year. And I got invited to be in, uh, entrepreneurs organization and said, well, you need a million in sales. And I remember going to our accountant like in January and going, okay, where do we hit? And we were like, $70 over a million or something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I thought we did it, but here&#8217;s how weird it was. More treehouse thing is like, That money didn&#8217;t flow directly to me. That was, I wasn&#8217;t swimming in the lap of luxury or anything. It was like that childhood c childish feeling of I get the high score on Gallagher. Oh wow. We did it. We did it. You know, and, uh, [00:32:00] but what&#8217;s, what&#8217;s crazy related to the whole entrepreneur journey is I think that was probably, I.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those circumstances and timing and backing into that was just ideal, obviously. But I go, it wasn&#8217;t all luck, right? It was both. It was all luck, all hard work. You know? It was both. Um, cuz I&#8217;ve since then tried to recreate the magic experiment, you know? Yeah. It was cool. My partner came in, I think it was our first year, we had our first office, and I would buy these, sorry, I&#8217;m these plastic tables from Sam&#8217;s Club.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mm-hmm. Basically picnic tables, you know. Yeah. And I was like, these are our desks. I held onto that for the longest time until we got our next office. And Matt was like my co he was like, Time to time to probably upgrade from the white desk. And I was like, no, I don&#8217;t want to. I did eventually. Um, but I think that was part of that magic right time, right place, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>People were partners, right. WordPress. Um, but it, I that those conditions were really conducive to creativity and magic and pulling. People were pull. Pulled in to that, like Christine was one, um, I think it was our second or third team member, man, changed the change, solidified the entire direction of the company and.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, huge, uh, different people like Dusti Bolton, Matt Danner, and Kristen Rutten, and different people that poured into our orbit. I go, wow, this is cool. So like when you talk about band, I go, that&#8217;s what my band was. Mm-hmm. Because it&#8217;s just like, we just made really good music for a long time. Yep. Uh, but how do I recreate that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s been the obsession for the last five years. Uh, until I just go, that was done. That was there. Yeah. That was album. I laid, we laid, excuse me. And it&#8217;s on to new music, right?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:03] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Yeah. Or yeah, arriving at a different thing, different voices. You can&#8217;t just recreate the same thing. Music&#8217;s always the perfect metaphor in, in entrepreneurship, ownership and programming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think there&#8217;s a reason why so many of us are into music or are musicians or whatever. Um, but yeah, and I think that&#8217;s, That&#8217;s what a lot of, like, I, I was really into all the entrepreneur stories for a long time and I&#8217;m glad I listened to a bunch of the podcasts and, you know, and whatnot. But you can&#8217;t recreate somebody else&#8217;s story can be inspired&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:44] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> by for sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:46] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Oh hundred percent. A hundred percent. And, and, and some of it is good advice or, you know, in certain situations you&#8217;re like, oh, you know, I remember this thing. It&#8217;s like, like reading a playbook, but you still have to know what plays to apply or whatever.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:01] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> I, so when I le met Lindsay and in like 2010, which was that year, we hit a million, um, we started this thing that, um, was called Startup Sofa.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:13] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> I&#8217;m sorry, I&#8217;m laughing because you know, you&#8217;re, She&#8217;s clearly in it for the money. Um, you know, yes. That year, you know, you were walking around being like, uh, my company just turned a million. You know what? Beautiful women want, want, want me now? She, she,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:30] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> she remembers. She goes, no, you know, we were dating when.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You hit your first six figure month. And I was like, Uhhuh, I realized everything got better with you. It did. Um, that&#8217;s the other way&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:44] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> she sees it. The she sees it the other way around. Yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:47] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> And it. And honestly, candidly, it did, everything did get better when you just had some like, like while we&#8217;re doing this together, not apart, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s right. It&#8217;s just better together. I&#8217;ve said that with post status. All the other things, it&#8217;s like, God, as much as I want to think I&#8217;m a solo act, I&#8217;m really not. Well, I&#8217;m much better as a collaborator. Um, oh, so we started, I started this thing called Startup Sofa, um, and tried to share all these things I had learned.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was laughing, telling her that, and I said, I was two years into this thing and thought I was, I could share, I do believe there&#8217;s a point where if you&#8217;re like one step, two step ahead of someone, sure it&#8217;s very helpful. It&#8217;s very good stuff. Like this is where I&#8217;ve got, uh, but I started laughing. I go, cuz now I try to share less.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I really actively try to not give advice as best I can until I go, okay, now it&#8217;s time for advice. I just share experiences cuz I go right. Everybody I hear doing that and you&#8217;re like, how long have you been doing this? All right. Have you been doing it exactly the way they have? Do you know their dna N do you know their company?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you know the mix? Do you know the environment? The answer is no. Very few bands lose their cover singer and have can just plug in another person and know, I think Queen is one of them, but you&#8217;re like, it&#8217;s very hard to, the magic is that band, those people that time to&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:12] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> do that. Yeah. Yeah. And I mean, you can&#8217;t, and time is is the other, is the other thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s like you can&#8217;t, you know, I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m stuck in that a little bit with music. It&#8217;s like I am, I am getting better and better at making a genre that basically died 10 years ago. I do it cuz I love it. And again, I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m, there are moments where I&#8217;m like, uh, these other genres are more popular. I would get more airplay if I switch genres again cuz I switched genres.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like I rode a lot, the wave of, a lot of genres for a lot of years and I was sincere about it. I wasn&#8217;t, cuz I, I&#8217;ve never made music thinking that it was really going to get popular or what have you. Um, But now I make the music that I love the most and nothing else has come along that I love more. Um, but, so if you&#8217;re the perfect band, but you&#8217;re making seventies rock, uh, you might have a hard time if it sounds too much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just like seventies rock, you know? Okay. That&#8217;s&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:15] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> so good because then I go, there&#8217;s this other part to the whole magic is that you want magic to happen. Probably some baseline passion, desire, interest for you. Seventies rock music, right? And I go, well, as time goes by, everything works in cycles. We know it might be dead 10 years ago, but it could be alive 10 years from now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you&#8217;re like, oh, it&#8217;s those people that I admire very much, Corey, that have their interests and desires and passions and don&#8217;t. Stop. Mm-hmm. There&#8217;s some little fire of that in what we&#8217;re talking about while we keep showing up on [00:39:00] Wednesdays. But I really admire it because I go, those are the people that, that something is gonna happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s probably gonna be better than what they imagined. Not what they imagined, but better. And, uh, I go to like seventies music. You said it just so organically. It&#8217;s something I, I like probably not gonna stop and then I go, well, if you stay around for another 20 years, Doing that, something&#8217;s gonna happen of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:25] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> right. I mean, that&#8217;s been proven over and over again and it doesn&#8217;t happen for everybody. And I&#8217;m, I have, you know, there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s two thi, two things, only two, there are at least two. One, one is persistence, um, doing what you love. And, but again, this is where, and for me it had to be. Calling it a hobby, you have to make your peace with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that&#8217;s the bigger, uh, the wider way to describe it is like there are people who are session musicians, you know, there are people who are, um, who will try to ride each wave to make the next, you know, hit song based on what trends are now. Um, there are people who would just grind. Um, Derek Sives talks a lot about this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Um, love his work. And, um, you know, and, and, uh, and he&#8217;s a good example. And other people, uh, who are like, okay, well I&#8217;m going to, I&#8217;m gonna do other things to, you know, to pay the bills, but, uh, my passion lies over here. And, uh, because it&#8217;s my passion, it will, I will always keep chipping away at it kind of thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, but I think, so that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s sort of one line. And then there&#8217;s another line, which is time and perspective and, um, Because you talk about good things will happen to them eventually. Right? And so it&#8217;s like I, for me, part of that I think can be the lowering of expectations, uh, which sounds so old and cynical and beaten down, but it&#8217;s like I get more out of.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Smaller things musically, like again, I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m getting older and older. The likelihood that even if I got a song that blew up, am I gonna tour on that at age 46? I also, I generally make music that that&#8217;s popular in England and so am I going to tour in England at age 46 and I can barely stay awake past 10:00 PM Am I, am I really gonna go DJ gigs at three in the morning?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No. You know, uh, and so managing, managing expectations and it&#8217;s like I&#8217;ve, but I, and being content with, uh, a little bit of airplay here and there, or the people who, uh, I&#8217;ve now been friends with for. You know, decades coming to me and saying like, this is the best song you&#8217;ve ever written. I&#8217;m like, that&#8217;s enough.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, I don&#8217;t, you know, yes, I would still love, you know, uh, endless BBC airplay or something, but the li the likelihood is less. And so it&#8217;s the, uh, staying consistent for me. Staying consistent, plugging away, doing what I wanna do, but then also being more and more content with, again, smaller wins. Um, cuz it&#8217;s like there&#8217;s, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, it&#8217;s hard not to like, um, I am reacting to what you just said of like going, there&#8217;s a lot of entrepreneur advice that, that the entrepreneurs that I was following, like for years I wanted to go to, um, Rob Walling and, and Mike, they do startups for the rest of us. Um, and they do a conference, MicroCon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. For years I wanted to go to MicroComp and, and then it, and, and I went to businesses, software, and some of these that were, I. Like only a few of the talks were relevant to the very, very bootstrapping I was doing. Um, and now even MicroComp, I mean, and years ago they split into two tracks. I don&#8217;t know where they are anymore, but the last time I looked, and this is no criticism of them, it&#8217;s just like I never.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I never was able to go up, up, up with all the other people that were going up, up, up. And so then they were all, you know, you, you were, you mentioned being a couple of rungs ahead of me. They were ladders ahead of me. And so it stopped being, um, pertinent. Um, and I also took my foot off the gas and, and aimed a little smaller.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And again, qualifying more the more side hustles and, and you know, uh, and stuff like that. And so it&#8217;s like, I struggle, I go back and forth, right? Pride at the end of my life, I, I would love to have owned a gajillion dollar company, or more importantly to me, honestly, would be to have a gajillion user product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, cuz it&#8217;s just more fun, frankly, and, and presume that money would come out of it and stuff like that. But it&#8217;s like, what are my, what are my actual goals? Like, why at 46 do I code extracurr? I, I, it&#8217;s a hobby. I love it. Okay, but what, what are the goals? You know, are there still goals? Am I still trying to earn millions of dollars?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like what is, it&#8217;s like I always, I always talk about, um, I don&#8217;t know, I, I don&#8217;t actually know anybody who makes canoes, but I always talk about, Uh, the, or I love the idea of a person who, cuz I think I, it&#8217;s the most frivolous thing I can think of. Um, and that&#8217;s that, and I don&#8217;t mean that negatively, but as a hobby, like in your garage, taking up most of your a, a car bay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So one of your cars probably has to be parked in the, in the driveway so that you can make a canoe. I guarantee you don&#8217;t need a canoe. And, and the world doesn&#8217;t need another canoe. There are canoes that you could go buy, probably get one for free because everybody buys a canoe and then never ends up using it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s, at least that was me, my family growing up. Um, but anyway, it&#8217;s like that to me is the epitome of a hobby. It&#8217;s pure love. Absolutely nothing in the world needs or requires or even probably encourages you to build a canoe, but you want to, so you&#8217;re gonna do it. Um, and that&#8217;s, and then I look at, at what I&#8217;m doing and it&#8217;s like, okay, well the, if, you know, the end goal of a canoe is that you can put it in the water and paddle it around, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s like, so the end goal for me, for building a product is users as people, users it. And I&#8217;m like, look, I, I brought value or joy or productivity or, you know, something that it&#8217;s validating. Um, You know, but, but in the grand scheme of things, like there was a time when I was like, you know, the goal is to make a gajillion dollars.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, now it&#8217;s like I&#8217;ve, I&#8217;ve gotten, I&#8217;ve gotten smaller and smaller and smaller. Now it&#8217;s to make a good product that people use. Mm-hmm. And it&#8217;s like, is that because I have failed so many times that my expectations have gone down, down, down, or. Is that still I&#8217;ve, I&#8217;ve, for myself, I have distilled it down to, that&#8217;s the first real spark, and then you kind of grow a, ideally grow a fire from there, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve got people using something, then you&#8217;ve got something, presumably, and then that&#8217;s where you, you know, uh, You are, you are the fuel, and I&#8217;m the f I&#8217;m the spark or whatever, you know, that&#8217;s where you and I collaborate because fire takes three things. Um, and so you, you can&#8217;t, you probably can&#8217;t do it yourself or you don&#8217;t want to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and, or, you know, the idea of cool people working together to build something bigger and bigger and bigger. And so part of the joy is like, I was texting my, talking about the, the startup in Nashville. I was texting with the ceo. Yes. This weekend, you know, and I haven&#8217;t, and that was at least 10 years ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s like friendships that last, or fond memories or, or war stories or, you know, I don&#8217;t know. It&#8217;s hard to, I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m totally rambling, but it&#8217;s hard to quantify now, harder to quantify now for me, like. Why on earth I do this, but I do it and it brings me joy and maybe that&#8217;s all I need.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:47:30] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Yeah. We&#8217;ve talked a lot about hobbies and historically I&#8217;ve been like, I don&#8217;t have hobbies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have work, I don&#8217;t have a home life. Um, and work was always my hobby. I mean, I would say even before I, I could, I had so much fun. It was like a hobby, I guess. Mm-hmm. Um, and most of the business was fun and I didn&#8217;t. Have time and want to have time for other hobbies. Like it had to be productive. When you said hobby, it&#8217;s like when you&#8217;re talking about the canoe, I go, there&#8217;s a reason the person has makes space in the garage and the significant other probably goes, we don&#8217;t have any garage cause the canoe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I go, that energy, that passion needs to take up space in your life somehow. And I go, so I haven&#8217;t had those. I do have two motorcycle, um, two motorcycles and the girls that don&#8217;t work. Um, but like what takes up space? I guess I was thinking what takes up space and this is it, this is part of this. So like we talked about it and your, your thoughts and hobbies have helped me so much more as go, I still think about it as.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For some reason, I, it&#8217;s hard for me to do something just for the value of doing it. The joy of doing it. Yeah. Um, I do have joy in doing things that build. I just want the practical something to the end. But I go, you know, this has, this, this time should take, uh, space in my life because I enjoy it. Right for that only value.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s something that did not exist probably a year ago, five years ago. 10 years ago. In my, in my mind, in my heart, because I was like, well, it&#8217;s just extra. It does take up just like the canoe in the garage takes up space, that other things could be there, but I go. No, enjoy talking to you. Enjoy having these conversations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enjoy tinkering with these products. This is our little mm-hmm. Garage hobby. You know, my version because I don&#8217;t physical things, you know, you build fences and stuff. Um, I, I don&#8217;t really do a lot of that. Don&#8217;t feel like I have always the ability and patience to do it, but I was like, hobby that builds, I, that&#8217;s my version of hobby is something, even when I could say I.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My reading hobby, my hiking hobby, for me, it still builds. I&#8217;d need that part. It&#8217;s just, it connects somewhere back. Um, like I can say we&#8217;re gonna my daughter and sent her home. Of course summer, we&#8217;ll go to the swimming pool. The value of that is rest and recuperation and enjoying time with them. That checks by something that builds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure. Thing, but I don&#8217;t know. As you were talking, I was like, no, it&#8217;s this time should take up this space. It has taken up, what, the last six months I think we&#8217;re our 18th session.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:50:40] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Yeah. I, yeah. I love, I love that you say it that way, like I think the hard part is, again, settling it in your own mind and then explaining it to other people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. And, and I know that we&#8217;ve struggled a little bit, um, where to my wife, it looks like I&#8217;m working all the time and I&#8217;m like, yeah. And sometimes I am. And sometimes it&#8217;s work, but it&#8217;s not earning me any money. And sometimes it&#8217;s fun and it&#8217;s not earning me any money. And it&#8217;s, you know, and it&#8217;s like there are four, the four quadrants of earns money or doesn&#8217;t, and it&#8217;s fun or it isn&#8217;t, but, um, and it&#8217;s client work or it&#8217;s not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, and I know that like my folks struggle with this too. My dad, my folks are retired, but my dad still writes papers, um, using research that he did during his career as a forester. Um, And it just brings him joy. And my mom&#8217;s like, get off the damn computer, where, you know, go play golf. We&#8217;re retired.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s not the retirement she wants. It&#8217;s the retirement he wants, you know? Um, and so it&#8217;s the hard, sometimes it&#8217;s hard to explain or show to other people, like, this is okay, this is what I wanna do. It&#8217;s like, as long as you&#8217;re getting enough exercise in vitamin D, you know, uh, but it&#8217;s, you know, cuz it&#8217;s, And it&#8217;s funny cuz people will look at gaming, you know, it&#8217;s like, oh, well you&#8217;re, you&#8217;re 10, 12 hours a day in front of the TV going zap, zap, zap or whatever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know? We&#8217;ll go, okay, that&#8217;s fi that&#8217;s fine. That&#8217;s a hobby. It&#8217;s like, It may or may not be the healthiest me sitting here typing, building something, and I&#8217;m not judging one against the other, obviously, but it&#8217;s the, like, it&#8217;s hard to, it&#8217;s, it, it&#8217;s not as easy to demonstrate that it&#8217;s the same sort of thing of like, no, this is fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:52:35] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Oh yeah. I, you know, self-care is all in the rage and I&#8217;m glad it is, but I go, it&#8217;s such an abstract concept for me. But because I&#8217;m, I try to be pretty practical with things, but I go, you know, that time and space is valuable to me. And you put the other part, is it seen as valued by others? And that&#8217;s another conversation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I go, what I&#8217;m trying to do is like, I don&#8217;t have those things. Maybe I don&#8217;t consciously have those things a take up space that I go, this is me, this is for me. Right. It&#8217;s for others but me and this whole concept of taking, so I says, what the heck does that talk about? It means for me personally, being in a line, not worrying about everybody else, necessarily worrying about me too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m okay to be in this space. Um, there&#8217;s a great person on Instagram talking about, or Instagram talking about Enneagram, and I&#8217;m an Enneagram nine, which is peacemaker Art Tap. And the one thing they said, take up space. And I said, I think I&#8217;m starting to get that now from canoe in the garage to standing in line.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you know what? I&#8217;m in this part and I&#8217;m gonna take this particular space, you know, for myself. Yeah. And I think that goes back to hobbies is now of course communication with sniff and others and all that stuff. But I go, it&#8217;s one added element I think our conversations have been so enriching for me is just go, it&#8217;s okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This time our async time takes up space and what I increasingly see is limited time. Yeah. And energy. But I go, I wanted to take up space. I wanted to take up that space. And you know, that&#8217;s the amber that I think keeps me coming to this. Uh, and then, you know, you never know. You just never know. Yep. Like we&#8217;re not losing our house families, all this stuff, like you said earlier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yep. So good reflection on a Wednesday.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:54:48] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> So, uh, I think both of us have limited availability for a while, but as we&#8217;ve said so I&#8217;m the only thing that is tugging at my sleeve. Given, given the reflection that we&#8217;ve just done, like I&#8217;m, I would be okay if time went by. Um, but the, the little bit that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s nagging at me is that we&#8217;re, we are really close.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like I have something working. Um, and so I think that that&#8217;s gonna keep, that&#8217;s gonna drive me soon to, again, start putting in a few hours here and there, um, to try to get something. Out the door, um, for you to use. For me to use and mm-hmm. Um, and you know, as quick as we can get it on the website. And, and so it&#8217;s on, it&#8217;s for sale.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, and there it is. People can try it. And, and you know, um, we were&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:55:55] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> talking about our, don&#8217;t think feature damages post says that are gonna, we got this new theme in staging. We&#8217;re gonna be launching before work camps. I&#8217;ll say July 1st, and realizing thumbnails on the feature, damage on the archive pages, uh, how we&#8217;re gonna do the feature damages in the post gonna need to change as an awareness thing from the post edit client side.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I go, this is gonna be good, you know, we&#8217;ll keep iterating on this. Um, with when, when you&#8217;re able to get the new update. Is, um, I think there&#8217;d be a lot of good feedback there, um, to how does that look on that home? How does that look on the inside page? That I think is that cornerstone to value for, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I like to say, I think it&#8217;s good timing when you get the new update, put it on staging, start trying it out. We&#8217;ll have another round of feedback.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:56:52] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Yeah, exactly. Exactly. So yeah, baby steps or big steps sometimes, you know. Yeah. But. Keep moving forward. Sounds good.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:57:04] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> All right. Thanks my friend.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:57:05] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Yeah, great talking as ever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You too.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:57:08] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Talk to you next week.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bye.</p>\n<p>This article was published at Post Status — the community for WordPress professionals.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 21 Jun 2023 21:01:39 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Cory Miller\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:32;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:54:\"Gravatar: New on Gravatar: Collect Payments on the Go!\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"http://blog.gravatar.com/?p=683\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:80:\"https://blog.gravatar.com/2023/06/21/new-on-gravatar-collect-payments-on-the-go/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1813:\"<p><strong>Have you updated your free Gravatar profile page recently?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are excited to announce the launch of new payment features on Gravatar profiles!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, you can add verified payment links for PayPal, Venmo, and Patreon and share your cryptocurrency wallet addresses (Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Ethereum, and more).

The people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and did this case, how and why WordCamps might change in the future?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast player of choice. Or by going to WPTavern.com forward slash feed forward slash podcast. And you can copy that URL into most podcast players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature on the podcast, I&#8217;m keen to hear from you, and hopefully get you or your idea featured on the show. Head to WPTavern.com forward slash contact forward slash jukebox. And use the form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today, we have Angela Jin. It&#8217;s the first of six episodes recorded at WordCamp Europe, 2023 in Athens, Greece.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Angela is the head of programs and contributor experience at Automattic, where she oversees the work of multiple teams dedicated to the WordPress open source project. These are the community events and engagement, education, and marketing teams. Her passion lies in building strong, inclusive communities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several weeks ago, Angela wrote a blog post entitled The Next Generation of WordCamps. It laid out how WordCamps have been run for many years, as well as trying to begin a conversation about how they might look in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the pandemic, online events filled the gap left by in-person gatherings, but they didn&#8217;t fully replace the experience. As restrictions eased in person WordCamps made a comeback. In 2022 there were around 35 events, with only one being held online. In 2023 there have been 20 events so far, and more a planned for the rest of the year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Angela talks about how she&#8217;s perceived a growing need for experimentation in the format of WordCamps. Currently, most WordCamps follow a tried and tested formula, with contributor days, multiple speaker presentations, the hallway track and sponsorship opportunities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She wanted to understand the purpose of gathering people together and what they gain from these events. To gather insights Angela had conversations with organizers, sponsors, speakers, and attendees within the WordPress community. She also sought out input from experts outside the community, such as the community manager focused group CMX.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The feedback confirmed to Angela that events are essential for communities, but also that there are many event formats being used elsewhere. She explains that there is an opportunity to add more variety to WordPress event formats, and explore the connections and opportunities they create.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We discuss some ways that WordCamps might evolve by having events focused on a particular area such as SEO, or a particular demographic such as students. We also get into how these amendments might be rolled out to ensure that interested groups and geographic locals don&#8217;t miss out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also chat about how sponsorship plays into these changes and how funding for WordPress events might be allocated in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Angela points out that there&#8217;s no specific format which has been proposed. Rather, this is a process of trying things out and seeing what works and what does not. The goal is to say yes to new event ideas and foster, a culture of innovation within WordPress events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re curious about how WordPress events might change in the future, this podcast is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more, you can find all the links in the show notes by heading over to WPTavern.com forward slash podcast where you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so without further delay, I bring you Angela Jin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast by Angela Gin. Hello, Angela.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:45] <strong>Angela Jin:</strong> Hello. How are you doing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:46] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. Really, really good. Thank you for joining me. We are at WordCamp Europe. Angela is going to talk to us today about, well, remarkably WordCamps and possibly the future of WordCamps. Prior to that conversation, Angela, would you mind just spending a minute just telling us who you are, who you work for, what your relationship is with WordPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:04] <strong>Angela Jin:</strong> So yes, my name is Angela Gin and I am with Automattic, where I am head of programs and contributor experience. I am full-time sponsored and so I get to work on the WordPress open source project for everything, which is fantastic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:19] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So we are at WordCamp Europe. Let&#8217;s just deal with that bit first, because I was just saying to somebody, I actually think of all the WordCamps I&#8217;ve ever attended, this feels like a really, truly remarkable event. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s just the configuration of the building, or how people are squeezed in by the corridors and things, but it does seem to be hugely attended.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:40] <strong>Angela Jin:</strong> It is. The attendance numbers that they showed at opening remarks this morning here, that they, what it was like 2,800 people, something like that. Over that, which is really exciting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:52] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So WordCamps are still popular? We might get into a conversation about whether there&#8217;s an ebb and flow to that. But big events like this are still a big part of people&#8217;s calendars.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:01] <strong>Angela Jin:</strong> For everybody here, certainly so. It is buzzing with activity here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:06] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> More broadly though, WordCamps and WordPress events, so we might use the word MeetUp for that, but I&#8217;ll just say WordPress events. Do they follow the trend of maintaining popularity? In the back of my mind when I ask that question is basically the pandemic. So pre pandemic everything was sailing along smoothly, and then we had this massive wall in the road. Everything stopped.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It felt like at that moment there was a bit of a change. The online events filled a gap, but they didn&#8217;t fill the entire gap. And then WordPress events came back online in various different formats. Where are we at now? Obviously this event is super well attended, but if we were to look at the whole of WordPress events, would that be the case, or are we still trying to rebuild a bit?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:54] <strong>Angela Jin:</strong> Yeah, I think we are definitely trying to rebuild, but I think that is true for everything, even not just events. So yes, prior to the pandemic we were smooth sailing. We were very active WordCamps around the world. And yeah, during the pandemic it was, we needed to shift how we met.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we met online and it was difficult. And so since 2021, we&#8217;ve started shifting into, I think we had one in-person WordCamp that year at the very, very end of the year. Last year in 2022, I believe we had around. 35 events total, and I think only one of them was online. And so clearly we are coming back, which is great. But we are nowhere near where we were prior to the pandemic. But I think that is, that&#8217;s very understandable. As we&#8217;re trying to get back into things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So far this year we are at, I believe we have had, not including this event because we&#8217;re not quite all the way through yet. I think we&#8217;ve had 20 events, I want to say. And so we&#8217;re well ahead of where we were compared to last year. And we do still have quite a few events on the calendar through the end of the year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So yeah, from a pure numbers of WordCamp perspective, I think we are trying our best to come back. From an attendance perspective, interestingly during when we had online events, our attendance rates far exceeded what we expected them to be. I think because it&#8217;s so easy to have an online event and then just show up for however much of it you want to show up for. And so, that&#8217;s an interesting attendance piece there. But attendance rates are pretty much in line with what we saw prior to the pandemic as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:43] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Oh really? As of now, so we&#8217;re recording this in June 2023. Broadly speaking, the numbers are similar to 2019, say.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:53] <strong>Angela Jin:</strong> So with fewer events, from a pure number of people&#8217;s perspective, fewer, but, the attendance rate for events, by which I mean expected attendance for events versus actual attendance. It&#8217;s always hovered around like 90 to 95% for events, and so we are, we&#8217;re holding study there, and also in the average number of attendees per event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:16] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay. We&#8217;re going to reference a piece that you wrote on make.wordpress.org. It was written last month, it was May 8th, and it was called The Next Generation of WordCamps. I think this will probably dominate the rest of the conversation. And in that piece you laid out the possible groundwork, I&#8217;ll say possible, for a change to the way these WordPress events are done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I could lead you with the questions, trying to tease out what&#8217;s in that article. I don&#8217;t know if you can remember all the details. But do you just want to run us broadly what you were saying in that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:46] <strong>Angela Jin:</strong> Yeah, that was, it was quite a post to write and to put out there. But I&#8217;m really excited by it. So, what I set out to do there was to capture some of the needed updates to our events program that I&#8217;m seeing, that I think we might need to have in our events program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The way this came about was pretty interesting because I think prior to the pandemic we were starting to see some people want more out of their WordCamps. And I think that makes a lot of sense. This format that we have has been the staple since 2006. And what&#8217;s really changed is how many events that we have, and the scale of them, and the size, and how many people are able to attend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, even prior to the pandemic, we were starting to hear from people that they wanted more variety in their content. They wanted advanced topics. They really wanted to be able to have more workshops to learn things that they were able to take back to their everyday lives. And that, coupled with all of the changes with the pandemic, at this point in WordPress events, I really started thinking about how the way that we meet has shifted dramatically. And after 20 years, of course, like that makes a lot of sense.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, I am very much a community manager at heart, and so when I think about gathering people together, I really think about what is the purpose of gathering people together. When we ask people to come join us in this space, why? Like what are they getting out of it? What draws them here? What makes the best use of their time and attention?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so that prompted a whole discovery session where, it was hard to write about at that time, because I wasn&#8217;t quite sure what I was getting myself into. I started really asking a bunch of people in the community, organizers, sponsors, speakers, first time attendees, experienced attendees. And I think everybody really loves this community. Like that is a resounding sentiment that I hear all the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And at the same time we want more out of our events, and we want some more specific things. And it was very similar to what I was seeing before the pandemic as well. And so there was a lot of, within the WordPress community, confirmation that this seemed like something needed to be updated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:15] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So, where did the information that people wanted this come from? Did you do surveys? Were you just polling in places like Slack? Where did the feedback that updates needed to be done, where did that tend to come from?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:28] <strong>Angela Jin:</strong> Yeah, for sure. So it did start with a lot of conversations within the community, with organisers, speakers, sponsors. And the community team is very fortunate to have this excellent community deputy group. They&#8217;re all past organizers, and are very experienced with the make community team. So they&#8217;re very familiar with our program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I started there. And then I also went outside of the WordPress community to chat with a number of event organizers, like event experts, people who do events for a living. To see what sort of trends that they were seeing as well. And one group that I really like to look to is CMX. It&#8217;s a community for community managers. And they, every year they put out an excellent report. They pole well over 400 community professionals from around the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And they confirmed that events are a staple for communities, and of course, no surprise there. And that it was both in-person and online events. And some of the report findings there, they were seeing where certain types of events were filling certain needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think, education is a really good one. So like trainings that we&#8217;re providing to our community, those are, really popular in both online and in person formats. And I think Learn WordPress has done a great job in continuing, like I think that helps me confirm what CMX expressed in their report, because we do have these great online workshops that happen all the time. They&#8217;re really well attended.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, trainings also work really well in person, according to the CMX report. And in-person events, it&#8217;s really good for one-on-one connection. Things like this when we&#8217;re looking at each other, having a conversation. And so, like different formats fill different spaces. And I think we are really missing an opportunity to add more variety into our event formats, and see what sort of connections that creates. What sort of opportunities that unlocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:33] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> We&#8217;ll get onto the new possible formats, and you&#8217;ve thrown out a whole bunch of different things that we might do. I&#8217;ve got a question around sponsorship. I don&#8217;t really know what the sponsorship picture is. I confess, I don&#8217;t. explore that data. I don&#8217;t try to find it. So, I don&#8217;t know what the state of sponsorships are. But how does that feed into this?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are you changing things? Has there been in the back of your mind changing things in order to attract sponsors? Has there been a, an up swell in the same way that you described just now that the community are coming back, there&#8217;s more people attending. Have the sponsorships come back? Because my understanding anecdotally, at least anyway, is there was a period a little while ago where the sponsorship felt a bit sketchy for a while. It wasn&#8217;t quite getting where it ought to be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:13] <strong>Angela Jin:</strong> Yeah, I think there&#8217;s a number of things there. As we all know, companies are very financially aware right now, and at the same time cost are extremely high. And so I think we are definitely feeling that pressure of really justifying the value of these events to sponsors and also being able to afford venues, for example. Venues are one of our, they are the highest cost right now. And then when you add on food, after party, AV, those expenses are very high right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so yeah, the amount of sponsorship that we want to raise is higher, and at a time where the economy is struggling, that&#8217;s a difficult thing. However, we are doing, we are doing well overall. I think, as you can tell from the sponsor activity downstairs, it seems to be doing really well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We raised enough for the global sponsors that we aim to raise, and we also just added another global sponsor. So overall we are doing well and I think it&#8217;s really wonderful that WordPress community support has always been very budget conscious. We work closely with organizers to make sure that we are as responsible and as aware of what we&#8217;re spending money on as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With new events, I think it&#8217;s a really interesting thing for sponsorship, and I have spoken with, before I posted that post, I did speak with our global sponsors because I didn&#8217;t want them to be surprised by this change, given that they fund all of our events for the full year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They were excited by it overall. They were seeing the same trends that I was seeing, and I was very clear that this is an experiment, and we&#8217;re going to, we&#8217;re going to encourage the community to try things out and see what happens. And that I really wanted to hear from them what sort of sponsor benefits they saw, they would like, and that we would have that conversation. Yeah, I think that&#8217;s largely what I&#8217;m seeing from our sponsors. They&#8217;re really curious to see what comes of this, and they&#8217;re excited as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:15] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I wonder, does an event like WordCamp EU , which is truly on a very different scale from let&#8217;s say a local meetup or something like that, or a much more regional WordCamp. It feels as if sponsors and all of that would be falling over themselves to come here, because they can capture a truly enormous audience of interested people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I wonder what the trickle down of that is. In other words, if we were to have the same conversation, but we weren&#8217;t sitting in WordCamp Europe and we were sitting in a much smaller event. How does the sponsorship work there? Are we still in a strong position to put on local WordCamps with the model that we&#8217;ve got and, Meetups, regional WordCamps, all of that kind of thing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because it feels like WordCamp Europe, that would almost be the last thing to fail. The sponsors would be desperate to get here. How is it looking for the smaller events, the ones in, I don&#8217;t know, capital cities or the ones in regional cities throughout the world?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:14] <strong>Angela Jin:</strong> It is different, given the scale of WordCamp Europe. Overall our events large and small, have, they&#8217;ve been able to raise a good amount of money locally. We do augment that with global sponsorship. That&#8217;s what the global sponsor fund is there for. And so yeah, we do our best to, the priority of WordCamps is the attendees. And so we really want our organizers to be able to focus on creating the best experience for WordCampers, as opposed to spending so much time raising money. Because fundraising is challenging. I&#8217;ve done plenty of it myself and it is hard work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:53] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Do you have a list of WordCamps which in an ideal world, these ones would be put on? In other words, I&#8217;ve got a list of 800, here&#8217;s the top 10 that we must make happen. Here&#8217;s a further a hundred, which we&#8217;d love to happen. And sadly there&#8217;s a few down here which might not make the cut. I don&#8217;t know how that decision tree looks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:11] <strong>Angela Jin:</strong> Oh, it&#8217;s very much up to the community. Any organizer that wants to have a WordPress event, the community team wants to support them in having that. That is very much what the community team is there for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I think one of, bringing this back to Next Gen events, one of the things that I was seeing that I think a lot of community members are seeing, from organizers, is that they have interest in doing something that&#8217;s a slightly different format from the WordCamps that we know and love.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But they feel like they can&#8217;t do that because it&#8217;s not a WordCamp. And I think we should be saying yes to those. We should be encouraging all those, all those really creative ideas for how to connect and engage with each other, not do them for sake of doing what we know and love.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:00] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I think it&#8217;s always true that things have to evolve. That much is clear. So let&#8217;s get into that. You just called it, them, Next Gen events. Whether or not that&#8217;s the word we end up using, I don&#8217;t know, but for now, let&#8217;s go with that. What are some of the things that you are proposing could be a Next Gen event? How do they differ?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, a WordCamp at the moment, at least the ones that I&#8217;ve been to, is several days. You show up, there&#8217;s often several tracks. There&#8217;s a whole range of different topics on offer. There&#8217;s usually a hallway track where people engage. There&#8217;s an after party, all of those kind of things. So that&#8217;s how we know it at the moment. What are you thinking of doing to change that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:39] <strong>Angela Jin:</strong> Yeah, I really am curious to see what people come up with. What I propose there was a really, I consider it more of a evolution as opposed to a change. We&#8217;re not doing away with any of the WordCamps that are currently on the calendar, that want to come and organize. What we are doing is encouraging community members to express what sort of events they want to see. And so a few that, I think I had included in that post, were things like, focused on contribution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They were focused on all day workshops that really help people learn specific skills. One thing that I&#8217;ve heard over and over is that people want to learn advanced skills. Advanced WordPress development, design, content creation, things like that. And so we could really do a lot with that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One interesting format, it was described to me as a shark tank, but nice. We&#8217;re a very, I know, I love that. We&#8217;re a very entrepreneurial community and if we&#8217;re going to help everybody really succeed in that, then we need to give them some place to come and explore their ideas. Learn from each other around what it really takes to make all of that happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, coming to an event, sharing a pitch, and getting feedback from people who have been there before, who are able to help them refine and strengthen their ideas and then make connections to make those happen. That&#8217;s pretty exciting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:13] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I&#8217;m going to quote directly from your piece because I think it perfectly sums up what you&#8217;d hope. What you are looking for in the future. So this is not a cast iron set of things which are going to happen. These are just some possible suggestions, and it says, so I quote, the hope is that a period of innovation and experimentation will follow this critical shift in the purpose of our rents with the following outcomes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Events curated for clearly defined audiences, resulting in a clearer idea of what attendees will gain from participating. For example, events for students, for designers, for contributors. So that&#8217;s point 1. Point 2, a more precise focus around event content types or topics. This will also help further clarify who the event is for. For example, maybe an event on AI and WordPress, user experience enterprise, et cetera. That&#8217;s point 2. And point 3, a variety of event formats that are freshly exciting and engaging for attendees. For example, workshops, unconference, job fairs, pure networking, et cetera.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there&#8217;s the three points, and each of those, if I attended an event like one of those, it would be radically different to something that we&#8217;re attending now. So let&#8217;s just take those piece by piece. This idea of defined audiences. So you mentioned here, for example, students, designers, contributors. That&#8217;s an idea, it may have legs, it may not. You&#8217;re trying to figure that out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is the intention there then to literally put an event up where it&#8217;s advertised toward students primarily, or to designers primarily. So people seeing that, who are not students, or not designers would feel, do you know what, that&#8217;s maybe one I&#8217;ll hold back on. I&#8217;ll look for a different one at a different point. Is that the idea of that one?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:51] <strong>Angela Jin:</strong> Yes, kind of. The point is definitely not to, I don&#8217;t want to exclude anybody from any of these events. However, I do think that, where we are in a world where finances are tightened, and it is expensive to commit to the time and to commit to the travel to an event, that people want to know what they are going to get out of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And by clearly articulating who this event is really designed for, we can provide an event that really delivers that kind of content. I was recently at Open Source 101, was held at a community college, and the mix there was very clearly students. Or people who were looking to change jobs into open source. And they were very clear from the beginning that this was,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, it&#8217;s in the name Open Source 101. This is introductory content for anyone who wants to learn about open source. It&#8217;s really broad, but at the same time, very clear about what you&#8217;re going to get by participating in this event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:55] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I guess because WordPress events have largely tried to scoop everybody up in the past. You know, if you&#8217;ve got in any way a connection to WordPress, you could attend this event. But I suppose I wouldn&#8217;t really be attending an event about, oh, I don&#8217;t know, let&#8217;s pluck some subject out of the top of my head. Cisco networking. It&#8217;s in the technology space. I&#8217;m not interested in it. I&#8217;d far rather attend a WordPress event. So what you&#8217;re really trying to do is subdivide what we&#8217;ve already got into maybe something that you would be just slightly more interested in, because it&#8217;s more directly related to what your business does or what you&#8217;re interested in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:30] <strong>Angela Jin:</strong> Yes, and I do think that there is a space where we are undeniably multidisciplinary. It does not serve us well to just have events where we only have developers meet in one location and community builders meet in another location. And yeah, there are many developers who are also community builders. I&#8217;m just pulling those two groups as examples. And so yeah, I would also love to see events where we do celebrate that multidisciplinary community, and bring all of them together because, amazing connections and ideas come from that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I&#8217;m not trying to segment the community into all these events, but to increase the variety in events and to help people understand what they&#8217;re going to get by participating in one or the other. And I think that for many WordPressers, they would benefit from an event that is specialized for them, with content where they are going to learn more than what they currently know and further their career, further their skills, further their interests. And to participate in another event where they can focus on learning more about something that they touch in their life, but don&#8217;t necessarily know a ton about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:47] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> The third bullet point that I just talked about there was event formats. And you mentioned workshops. I&#8217;m quite familiar with that. We have those at WordCamps, so it&#8217;s more, instead of being presented at, from a stage, that&#8217;s more, okay, let&#8217;s all try the things together. You bring your laptop and we&#8217;ll all try to figure out the same problem at the same time. But there are some other ones in there that are really new to me. So an unconference. What is that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:12] <strong>Angela Jin:</strong> I think it&#8217;s also referred to as like birds of a feather. I think it has its roots in the tech community where we basically just get a bunch of people together in a room, around one topic, and the attendees really drive the agenda.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They suggest a topic around what everybody is brought here for. And then people will vote with their feet and go to those discussions to talk about them. And so the conversation is very, very attendee driven and very organic. There&#8217;s no one speaker. Sometimes there is, whoever proposes the topic can be the facilitator, but that&#8217;s not a requirement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:50] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I think the other ones we probably understand a little bit more as well. So we&#8217;ve just mentioned workshops, unconferences, job fairs, and pure networking. They probably speak for themselves. So I&#8217;ll leave those to one side.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is there a danger that one of the consequences of trying this out is that we will end up with events which are more specific? That therefore would attract a more specific audience? At the moment, if you wander downstairs into the hall, there&#8217;s just this broad church of people from all over the world with different backgrounds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, you&#8217;ve got the SEO people, the marketing people, the coders. You name it, they&#8217;re there. And because of that, you get this serendipitous collision of people meeting in the hallway track. Unexpected connections are made. Unexpected partnerships are forged, and all of that. Is there a danger that we may lose a part of that? And that&#8217;s an unquantifiable part because nobody&#8217;s really writing up what connections they made. It just is what people talk about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is there a danger that that may be lost, because we&#8217;ve just got a bunch of SEO people in the room, or we&#8217;ve just got a bunch of AI people in the room</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:55] <strong>Angela Jin:</strong> I understand that worry, and I see where the post might make that feel more like a reality. But I can never imagine a WordPress community that would ever let that go. I want to encourage that as well because I love it. One of the concerns that came, that I&#8217;m hearing after this post, is are we going to lose that community led feel of our events?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I do not want to. Like that is, that is our strength. We are community first. All of our events are very community first. And we have a number of values that come along with that that I truly feel are non-negotiable. Things like our ticket prices to attend WordCamps are very low.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We want to make them as accessible as possible. I don&#8217;t want to lose that. I want to be able to have everybody come to these events. And so things like diversity and inclusion and creating welcoming spaces, those are all non-negotiables. And so I really believe that we can take this experiment, this evolution, and make it community led.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we do have a ton of businesses in WordPress, and I could see a more business focused event, where it is for agencies, for enterprise, because they are a part of this community. And I believe we can do those events as community led first.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:19] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I guess there&#8217;s something about geography in here as well in that if, let&#8217;s say, you have a business event and it&#8217;s in Miami. Then Miami has had its business event. But Sydney didn&#8217;t. Brussels didn&#8217;t. So there&#8217;s got to be some new piece of the puzzle where, okay, we&#8217;ve got to make sure that we&#8217;ve got these new event types and we&#8217;ve got to spread them out evenly over time so that we don&#8217;t exclude Miami. They never get the SEO event, it never comes their way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there&#8217;s a whole other piece about, there&#8217;s more management to be done about the topics and whether a certain geographical area has had something recently, or if it&#8217;s been five years ago. Do you know what I mean?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:55] <strong>Angela Jin:</strong> Yeah. And in my mind, this goes to one of our open source philosophies that we create things because we&#8217;re scratching an itch. And so yeah, if Miami has an amazing contribution event and Brussels says we want one too, then let&#8217;s do it. Like I said, the community team it wants to encourage events, so let&#8217;s have it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:19] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> With this change over happening, presumably there&#8217;s going to be a period where the events that we&#8217;re used to will carry on. So, I think you said a little while ago that if you&#8217;re already on the roster, if you&#8217;ve already put in a proposal and it&#8217;s been accepted, we are going to be staying with how it always has been. So it&#8217;s more from now on. You&#8217;re going to be encouraging people who haven&#8217;t yet submitted proposals. Is that true? Is that how it&#8217;s going to be rolled out?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:42] <strong>Angela Jin:</strong> Yeah, we want to support all organizers to know the latest and greatest in the program. And so yeah, as new organizers come, we will let them know about what the community is doing, and where we&#8217;re going, where we hope to go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is very much an experiment and it seems to be getting a lot of interest. We already have, I believe, over 60 idea submissions. We do have an idea submissions page, so if there is an event that you would like to see, please, please do go and share it with us. By sharing an idea, you are not committed to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But part of what we&#8217;re trying to do is to collect all of these great ideas and share them with everyone so that if something sparks interest in people, they can do it in their community. Or if they have an idea to add on top of that, let&#8217;s try it out. I&#8217;m really hoping that we learn from each other to see where this goes. It is an experiment. If we all decide that we don&#8217;t like it and it doesn&#8217;t work, then we can definitely go back to what we know and do really well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:44] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You&#8217;ve already anticipated one of my questions, which was do we have a reverse gear?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:48] <strong>Angela Jin:</strong> Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:49] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> In terms of this being rolled out, if I have already submitted a proposal, we know where that&#8217;s going now. How though are we going to make the transition? Are we going to do it all at once? So we&#8217;re going to, let&#8217;s say two years from now, a new event and it&#8217;s about this one topic. Are we going to mix what we&#8217;ve got now? So say one day, just like it is at the minute, with another day of the new format, so that people can attend both at the same time and vote with their feet if you like?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And a poll afterwards to figure out, okay, everybody like the new format, let&#8217;s push forward with that. In other words, how are you going to manage the rollout? Is it going to be sudden? So a new event is a new type, or are you going to gently mix it in with the old ones?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:29] <strong>Angela Jin:</strong> I don&#8217;t know. I think it&#8217;s really going to be what the community would like to see. We are starting to see people, there&#8217;s a lot of excitement for this from what I can see. We already have organizers reaching out to the community team to host these events. We are also figuring out the tooling for it right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, there&#8217;s another post about that, please go share your thoughts on that. But we do have some that are being scheduled. I believe there is one event that is, actually we talked about this, an event for organizers to, to help train other organisers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:04] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Like an event for an event?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:06] <strong>Angela Jin:</strong> Yes. I&#8217;m hearing about events that want to bring WordPress to communities that don&#8217;t necessarily have a strong WordPress community or any WordPress community at all. And see how bringing this technology to a different place, how it goes. And I&#8217;m also hearing events where we want to provide, new to WordPress, come to this day of workshops and learn how to use the site editor and learn how to, launch your own website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:36] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So new events will be more refined? At the moment if we attend an event, we can see, let&#8217;s say an event like this, we can probably see 30 different topics. We&#8217;re going to refine the events. Are there certain things which are outside of the remit of an entire event?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, for example, SEO feels like a big enough subject for an entire WordCamp. There&#8217;s enough content there. But maybe there&#8217;s something a bit more niche, which you hear once at an event like the one we&#8217;re at. But it wouldn&#8217;t span the whole weekend say.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s my question really. Are there some things which are within the purview of this and some things which you are excluding? You maybe don&#8217;t have any thoughts on that, but I&#8217;m just curious to know if there is going to be some things which are in scope and other things which are not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:21] <strong>Angela Jin:</strong> Yeah, it&#8217;s an interesting question because, I think everything that we&#8217;re seeing proposed right now does very much feel within the scope. But I&#8217;m sure at some point there&#8217;s going to be some topic that raises some eyebrows. And I think this is why having a purpose is really helpful for that. Because we are asking that. How does your idea align with the purpose of what we&#8217;re trying to do here?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I would really encourage us to be experimental because WordPress is not an island. We are a part of a much larger tech ecosystem and understanding the external influences to WordPress, and how WordPress influences those areas is really important, and will help us grow. And help us bring new people in, new ideas in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would like to, I keep coming back to this word, but I would really like to be very experimental about it. And like I said, if we don&#8217;t like it, we can always go back and we have a very strong track record of being responsible with sponsor dollars. And so if there is an event that we&#8217;re like, hmm, like, we&#8217;re not quite sure how that&#8217;s going to work out, maybe we try it in a smaller scale and see how we can scale it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:34] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You could try something a bit novel in a smaller event and see if it&#8217;s popular, see if it gains traction and what have you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:40] <strong>Angela Jin:</strong> I&#8217;m really excited to see where this goes. And it is really lovely being here at WordCamp Europe to talk about this, because I&#8217;m excited by how excited everybody else is about this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think there are a lot of questions about it, which is totally understandable, and I really believe that we can figure them out together. So, yeah, let&#8217;s see where it goes. And the only thing I would add is, please come and share your thoughts. Please share your thoughts on the idea as a whole, what ideas you have for events, and on what potential tooling needs we might need.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:13] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Where do we share the thoughts?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:15] <strong>Angela Jin:</strong> Uh, yes. There are three posts on the community, on the make community blog, and that is where a lot of the discussion is happening. The community team has regular meetings where this is a regular topic of conversation. And so yeah, come chat with any of the community deputies. Come chat with me and yeah, let&#8217;s see where this goes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:36] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So I will link to those places in the show notes. So if you&#8217;re curious about anything that Angela said, you can find the post on WP Tavern, and click on the links. Angela Jin, thank you very much for talking to me today. I really appreciate it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:47] <strong>Angela Jin:</strong> Thank you.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today we have <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/angelasjin/\">Angela Jin</a>. It’s the first of six podcast episodes recorded at WordCamp Europe 2023, in Athens, Greece.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Angela is the Head of Programs and Contributor Experience at Automattic, where she oversees the work of multiple teams dedicated to the WordPress open source project. These are the community events and engagement, education, and marketing teams. Her passion lies in building strong, inclusive communities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several weeks ago, Angela wrote a blog post entitled <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/angelasjin/\">The Next Generation of WordCamps</a>. It laid out how WordCamps have been run for many years, as well as trying to begin a conversation about how they might look in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the pandemic, online events filled the gap left by in-person gatherings, but they didn&#8217;t fully replace the experience. As restrictions eased, in-person WordCamps made a comeback. In 2022, there were around 35 events, with only one being held online. In 2023, there have been 20 events so far, and more are planned for the rest of the year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Angela talks about how she’s perceived a growing need for experimentation in the format of WordCamps. Currently, most WordCamps follow a tried and tested formula, with contributor days, multiple speaker presentations, the hallway track and sponsorship opportunities. She wanted to understand the purpose of gathering people together and what they gain from these events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To gather insights, Angela had conversations with organisers, sponsors, speakers, and attendees within the WordPress community. She also sought input from event experts outside the community, such as the community manager-focused group CMX.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The feedback confirmed to Angela that events are essential for communities but also that there are many event formats being used elsewhere. She explains that there is an opportunity to add more variety to WordPress event formats and explore the connections and opportunities they create.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We discuss some ways that WordCamps might evolve by having events focussed upon a particular area, such as SEO, or a particular demographic, such as students. We also get into how these amendments might be rolled out to ensure that interested groups and geographic locales don’t miss out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also chat about how sponsorships play into these changes and how funding for WordPress events might be allocated in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Angela points out that there’s no specific format which is being proposed, rather this is a process of trying things out and seeing what works and what does not. The goal is to say &#8220;yes&#8221; to new ideas and foster a culture of innovation within WordPress events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re curious about how WordPress events might change in the future, this podcast is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Useful links.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2023/05/08/the-next-generation-of-wordcamps/\">The Next Generation of WordCamps</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cmxhub.com/\">CMX website</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.com/learn/\">Learn WordPress</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://opensource101.com/\">Open Source 101 website</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 21 Jun 2023 14:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Nathan Wrigley\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:35;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"Akismet: Saying No To Spam on Smitten Kitchen’s Popular Food Site\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:27:\"http://akismet.com/?p=77586\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"https://akismet.com/blog/saying-no-to-spam-on-smitten-kitchens-popular-food-site/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10780:\"<div class=\"wp-block-group alignfull is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">TL;DR</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>For many bloggers, they see their site as a path to transfer their passion in a hobby into a follow-time career.

The site was created by Deb Perelman in 2006. The blog has catapulted Deb into the ranks of celebrity chefs, as she has <a href=\"https://smittenkitchen.com/books/\">three best-selling cookbooks</a>, appeared as a judge on<a href=\"https://www.foodnetwork.com/shows/beat-bobby-flay/episodes/the-nightmare-before-pastry\"> Beat Bobby Flay</a>, and has <a href=\"https://smittenkitchen.com/about/\">other culinary achievements.</a>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http://Her blog at SmittenKitchen.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">SmittenKitchen.com</a> continues to be the primary connection point with her fan base. Comments are critical. In fact, when Deb launched the blog it was focused on dating, and she met her husband-to-be in the comments section of her blog – he was the fourth person to comment.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reader comments for each recipe often number in the thousands such as this post for <a href=\"https://smittenkitchen.com/2008/09/moms-apple-cake/\">Mom’s Apple Pie</a> and this post for <a href=\"http://v\">B</a><a href=\"https://smittenkitchen.com/2009/07/best-birthday-cake/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">est Birthday Cake</a>, with fans asking questions and sharing their stories of success and failure with the recipes. In some cases, a fan might just want to leave a single word or short sentence to express their appreciation. If the fan had to face a captcha every time, or worse comments were turned off, the site might have many fewer comments.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What is vital is the lack of spam in the comment section. On other recipe and food sites, you might find self-serving affiliate links or off-topic promotions snuck in. If spam was prevalent on SmittenKitchen.com, it would send a signal that the community was not authentic and that nobody cared to curate the site.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2000 comments for a single recipe on&nbsp;SmittenKitchen.com</h3>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1392\" height=\"988\" src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/2000-comments.png?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-77592\" />\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Multiple Benefits to Akismet</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For the past three years now, Smitten Kitchen has been running Akismet to block spam in comments. The benefits of Akismet are:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Smitten Kitchen doesn’t need to hire a moderator to manually review comments.&nbsp;As Akismet is a WordPress plugin and is automatically updated, nobody at Smitten Kitchen needs to manage it.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Commenters don’t need to pass any captcha tests to prove they are not robots in order to leave a comment.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Some sites don&#8217;t offer comments.

I am Igor Ligay, the CEO and co-founder of Stylemixthemes.com. Our company specializes in creating exceptional WordPress plugins and themes. Currently, I split my time between Dubai (UAE) and Tashkent (Uzbekistan).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2007, during my second year at university, my cousin Victor approached me with a life-changing idea. Together with our friends Arseniy and Alexander, we founded Stylemix, a company aimed at developing websites for local and international businesses in Uzbekistan. Initially, it started as a part-time venture, but we soon delved into strategies to market our services to local companies. As my family could no longer support me financially, it became crucial for me to start earning my own income. This opportunity presented itself as a chance to transform my life for the better. Working tirelessly, often until midnight, I sought international clients on Elance.com, utilizing WordPress to build their websites. This experience instilled in me the values of hard work and determination, and I am grateful for the lessons learned during those early days. Since 2008, we have been actively working with WordPress, and today our team comprises over 50 talented designers, developers, and managers who are passionate about creating high-quality products that facilitate the growth and success of businesses worldwide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During our time on Elance, we acquired expertise in creating visually appealing custom WordPress themes with unique designs. However, the cost of such websites was often high due to the custom design aspect. To cater to customers looking for more affordable options, we began exploring alternative solutions and discovered Themeforest.net. Here, we purchased premium WP themes and utilized them to swiftly and easily create new websites for our clients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A major breakthrough occurred for us in 2011-2012 when we conceived the idea of developing our own themes. Leveraging our experience in WordPress development, we designed our first WP theme and listed it on Themeforest. The publication process was arduous, as reviewers were initially critical of our design, typography, UI, and other elements. However, after several iterations, our item was accepted and gained popularity within the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Realizing that building custom WordPress websites for clients was limiting our growth potential, we made a bold decision to transition from being a service provider to a product-oriented company. This strategic shift allowed us to expand our reach and cater to a wider audience, thereby driving the success of our company. Over time, we received valuable feedback, suggestions, and advice from customers, leading us to implement new features, services, and industry-specific WP themes like Education and Car Dealership themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Until March 2021, Themeforest proved to be an effective sales channel for us, with a significant increase in earnings in 2020 due to COVID-19 lockdowns. However, sales started declining rapidly after March 2021, causing concern as we had ambitious plans for further growth. We observed that many successful WordPress theme and plugin companies were using Freemius, so we decided to give it a try.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our second major breakthrough occurred in 2021 when we shifted our focus from WordPress themes development to WordPress plugin development. This pivot was prompted by the decline in sales on Themeforest.net, compelling us to redirect our team&#8217;s efforts towards a new direction. Freemius platform enabled us to effectively sell our Pro plugin version, offering all the features we had been seeking. The transition to WordPress plugin development has been a resounding success, and we take pride in the progress we have made thus far.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, there are a few reasons why we chose to shift our focus from Envato (Themeforest) to Freemius for selling WordPress plugins directly from our company’s website:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, Themeforest lacked the flexibility to adapt to the subscription-based model that is prevalent today. We were compelled to sell one-time purchases and promote our support as a subscription-like service. Ideally, vendors should have the freedom to choose between lifetime and subscription models, enabling developers like us to opt for the solution that best aligns with our business strategy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another reason for our shift was the inability to track conversions, customer journeys, and directly contact customers, as Envato does not share customer emails. Without the necessary data and insights, it was challenging to shape our strategies effectively.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, we believe that themes and plugins are distinct products. The market for themes has been disrupted by Elementor page builder, and the introduction of Gutenberg is poised to bring further changes. On the other hand, plugin development is akin to software development. While no-code solutions are also altering this landscape, we are actively building no-code functionalities for the benefit of our WordPress users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is important to note that Themeforest can still be a suitable platform for conducting business, as it has worked for many others. However, we have outgrown it and require a platform that can support our growth in an increasingly competitive market, aligning with our evolving strategies.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Stylemix Today</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The journey we embarked on, myself, my partners, and our dedicated employees, has been long and filled with challenges. We weathered economic crises and overcame adversities like the COVID-19 pandemic. Stylemix has evolved into a reliable source of income, not only for me but for every member of our team. While we may not offer the highest salaries compared to other IT companies in Uzbekistan and elsewhere, what sets us apart is the exceptional work environment, the bonds of friendship among colleagues, our unwavering commitment to WordPress products, and our Kaizen philosophy. These elements combine to create an invaluable working experience for our team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Progressing our company hasn&#8217;t been easy, but we continue to strive forward. We actively participate in WordCamps, Envato meetups, and various WordPress-related events to forge connections with new partners, authors, marketers, and more. Being a part of the WordPress community fills us with pride, as we recognize that WordPress has not only transformed my life but also the lives of my employees. It is a testament to the fact that without WordPress, we would be on a different path today. Ultimately, WordPress has played a pivotal role in the growth and success of Stylemix.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-has-helped-me-move-forwards\"><strong>What has helped me move forwards</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>My shareholders are more than just business partners; they have played an instrumental role in my personal growth. As a team of four shareholders, we engage in open discussions about business strategy and product analytics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I firmly believe that learning is a lifelong journey. I seek inspiration and motivation by reading books, watching interviews with IT founders, staying up to date with WordPress-related blogs, and attending meetups. These activities have facilitated my continuous evolution and development as a business leader. I am committed to pursuing new opportunities for growth and learning.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Final Words</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>My journey as an entrepreneur in the WordPress community, particularly as a plugin developer, has been an incredible ride. From the inception of the idea to its launch and continuous improvement, it has been a journey marked by dedication, hard work, and perseverance. I have learned the importance of task prioritization, constant innovation, and embracing customer feedback. We are grateful to our customers and partners who have supported us along the way, contributing to the enhancement of our products and our success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we look towards the future, our team is filled with excitement about the possibilities that lie ahead. We remain committed to providing customers with the best possible experience and continuously improving our portfolio of WordPress plugins with each update.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"kb-row-layout-wrap kb-row-layout-id_fecc51-19 alignnone kt-row-has-bg wp-block-kadence-rowlayout\"><div class=\"kt-row-column-wrap kt-has-1-columns kt-row-layout-equal kt-tab-layout-inherit kt-mobile-layout-row kt-row-valign-top\">\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-kadence-column kadence-column_a030cf-cb\"><div class=\"kt-inside-inner-col\">\n<h2 id=\"work-environment\" class=\"kt-adv-heading_7ab40e-67 wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\">Igor&#8217;s Work Environment</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We asked Igor for a view into his development life and this is what he sent! </p>\n\n\n	<div class=\"hotspots-image-container\">\n		<img width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/igor_ligay_desktop.jpg\" alt=\"Igor Ligay\" class=\"hotspots-image skip-lazy\" />\n	</div>\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"kt-adv-heading_65b746-81 wp-block-kadence-advancedheading has-theme-palette-9-background-color has-background\">HeroPress would like to thank <a href=\"https://wpdrawattention.com/\">Draw Attention</a> for their donation of the plugin to make this interactive image!</p>\n</div></div>\n\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"russian\">От сервис провайдера до мощной продуктовой компании: Раскрывая путь в мире WordPress</h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Привет! Я Игорь Лигай, генеральный директор и сооснователь Stylemixthemes.com. Наша компания специализируется на создании выдающихся плагинов и тем для WordPress. В настоящее время я живу в Дубаи (ОАЭ) и в Ташкенте (Узбекистан).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>В 2007 году, во время моего второго года университета, мой двоюродный брат Виктор предложил мне жизненно важную идею. Вместе с нашими друзьями Арсением и Александром мы основали компанию Stylemix, которая занималась разработкой веб-сайтов для местных и международных бизнесов в Узбекистане. Изначально это было небольшим хобби, но вскоре мы начали заниматься маркетингом наших услуг для местных компаний. Так как моя семья больше не могла финансово поддерживать меня, для меня стало крайне важным начать зарабатывать собственный доход. Эта возможность представляла собой шанс изменить мою жизнь к лучшему. Работая неустанно, часто до полуночи, я искал международных клиентов на Elance.com и использовал WordPress для создания их веб-сайтов. Этот опыт привил мне ценности трудолюбия и настойчивости, и я благодарен за уроки, полученные в те ранние дни. С 2008 года мы активно работаем с WordPress, и сегодня наша команда включает более 50 талантливых дизайнеров, разработчиков и менеджеров, увлеченных созданием качественных продуктов, способствующих росту и успеху бизнеса во всем мире.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Во время работы на Elance мы приобрели экспертизу в создании привлекательных пользовательских тем для WordPress с уникальными дизайнами. Однако стоимость таких веб-сайтов часто была высокой из-за индивидуального дизайна, который мы рисовали с нуля. Чтобы удовлетворить клиентов, ищущих более доступные варианты, мы начали исследовать альтернативные решения и обнаружили Themeforest.net. Здесь мы покупали премиум-темы WP и использовали их для быстрого и легкого создания новых веб-сайтов для наших клиентов.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Переломным моментом для нас стал 2011-2012 год, когда мы придумали идею разработки собственных тем. Используя наш опыт в разработке WordPress, мы создали нашу первую тему WP и разместили ее на Themeforest. Процесс публикации был сложным, так как модераторы изначально были критичны к нашему дизайну, типографике, пользовательскому интерфейсу и другим элементам. Однако после нескольких итераций наша тема была принята и получила популярность в сообществе.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Понимая, что создание индивидуальных веб-сайтов на WordPress для клиентов ограничивает наш потенциал роста, мы приняли смелое решение перейти от поставщика услуг к продуктовой компании. Этот стратегический поворот позволил нам обслуживать более широкую аудиторию, способствуя успеху нашей компании. С течением времени мы получали ценные отзывы, предложения и советы от клиентов, что привело нас к внедрению новых функций, услуг и тем WP для конкретных отраслей, таких как образование и автодилерские темы.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>До марта 2021 года Themeforest был для нас эффективным каналом продажи, и в 2020 году мы заметно увеличили свою прибыль из-за локдауна в эпоху COVID-19. Однако после марта 2021 года продажи резко снизились, вызвав беспокойство, так как у нас были амбициозные планы по дальнейшему росту. Мы заметили, что многие успешные компании по разработке тем и плагинов для WordPress используют Freemius, поэтому мы решили попробовать его.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Второй важный момент нашего развития произошел в 2021 году, когда мы сместили фокус с разработки тем WordPress на разработку плагинов WordPress. Этот поворот был вызван снижением продаж на Themeforest.net и заставил нас перенаправить усилия нашей команды в новом направлении. Платформа Freemius позволила нам успешно продавать нашу Pro-версию плагина, предлагая все необходимые функции. Переход к разработке плагинов WordPress стал большим успехом, и мы гордимся тем, что сделали правильное решение.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Более того, есть еще несколько причин, по которым мы решили сместить свое внимание с Envato (Themeforest) на Freemius для продажи плагинов WordPress непосредственно на веб-сайте нашей компании:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Во-первых, Themeforest не обладал гибкостью для адаптации к модели подписки, которая сегодня является распространенной. Мы вынуждены продавать одноразовые покупки и предлагать нашу поддержку в виде услуги, похожей на подписку. Продавцы должны иметь свободу выбора между пожизненной лицензией и моделью по подписке, чтобы разработчики, как мы, могли выбрать решение, которое лучше соответствует нашей бизнес-стратегии.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Еще одной причиной нашего перехода было отсутствие возможности отслеживать конверсии, путь клиента и напрямую общаться с клиентами, так как Envato не предоставляет адреса электронной почты клиентов. Без необходимых данных и информации было сложно эффективно формировать наши стратегии.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Кроме того, мы считаем, что темы и плагины &#8211; это разные продукты. Рынок тем уничтожается дешевыми решениями от Elementor и Gutenberg. С другой стороны, разработка плагинов напоминает разработку программного обеспечения.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Themeforest все еще может быть хорошей платформой для ведения бизнеса, так как на ней до сиз пор продают многие другие компании. Однако мы переросли ее и нуждаемся в платформе, которая может поддержать наш рост на все более конкурентном рынке, соответствуя нашим стратегиям.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Stylemix сегодня</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Путь, который мы начали более 10 лет назад, привел нас к успеху и признанию в сообществе разработчиков WordPress. Мы гордимся тем, что стали руководителями в создании тем и плагинов WordPress для различных отраслей. Наша команда продолжает разрабатывать инновационные решения, следуя современным трендам и потребностям пользователей.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Мы по-прежнему стремимся создавать высококачественные продукты, способствующие успешному онлайн-присутствию наших клиентов. Наша цель &#8211; помочь предпринимателям, брендам и организациям достичь своих целей и раскрыть свой потенциал через WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Если у вас есть какие-либо вопросы или потребности, пожалуйста, не стесняйтесь обратиться ко мне или нашей команде. Мы всегда готовы помочь и поделиться нашими знаниями и опытом с вами.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Продвижение нашей компании не было простым, но мы продолжаем стремиться вперед. Мы активно участвуем в мероприятиях WordCamp, встречах Envato и различных событиях, связанных с WordPress, чтобы установить связи с новыми партнерами, авторами, маркетологами и другими представителями отрасли. Быть частью сообщества WordPress наполняет нас гордостью, поскольку мы понимаем, что WordPress не только изменил мою жизнь, но и жизни моих сотрудников. Это свидетельство того, что без WordPress мы бы шли по другому пути сегодня. В конечном счете, WordPress сыграл решающую роль в росте и успехе Stylemix.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>То, что помогает мне двигаться вперед</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Мои акционеры &#8211; это не просто партнеры по бизнесу; они сыграли важную роль в моем личном росте. В качестве команды из четырех акционеров мы ведем открытые дискуссии о бизнес-стратегии и аналитике продукта.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Я твердо верю, что обучение &#8211; это путь на всю жизнь. Я ищу вдохновение и мотивацию, читая книги, смотря интервью с основателями IT-компаний, следя за блогами, связанными с WordPress, и посещая мероприятия. Эти активности способствуют моему непрерывному развитию и эволюции в качестве бизнес-лидера. Я стремлюсь открывать новые возможности для роста и обучения.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Заключительные слова</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Мое путешествие в качестве предпринимателя в сообществе WordPress, особенно в качестве разработчика плагинов, было невероятным интересным. От зарождения идеи до ее запуска и непрерывного совершенствования &#8211; это путь, отмеченный преданностью, усердием и настойчивостью.

Zieliński believes this implementation can even be turned into an app template to build a WordPress app with the click of a button.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Playground, as a WebAssembly software, brings WordPress to Node.js, mobile devices, desktop apps, ecosystems like VS Code that support JavaScript extensions,&#8221;  Zieliński said. &#8220;The mobile app, desktop app, and a hosted web app could all use the same code and also provide a Playground-based demo version.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zieliński said he expects to see people building mobile apps in the future &#8220;with nothing more than a WordPress plugin.&#8221; This would drastically reduce the learning curve for creating and customizing mobile apps. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Or even better, with no code at all – they’d just use the admin interface to configure a WordPress site to look and act like an app,&#8221; he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Changing the app look and feel could be the same as switching a theme in WordPress.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zieliński has a virtually inexhaustible spring of ideas for how the WordPress Playground can benefit the ecosystem and his passion for the project is evident in a recent <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/live/LkWd7w7UkIM?feature=share\">interview on The Code and Coffee Show</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Blocknotes app offers a solid example of WordPress Playground working in the real world. It&#8217;s a use case that seems to have resonated strongly with developers as a new way to run WordPress across platforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The app is not yet available in the app store but it can be <a href=\"https://testflight.apple.com/join/1LHlA8uA\">tested via the TestFlight app</a>. van Durpe said it can <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ellatrx/status/1669597479501717505\">can also be installed on macOS</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Blocknotes is available for beta testing! <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f6a7.png\" alt=\"🚧\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> Even though I already use it for my notes, be careful!

Demos and testing sites can be launched instantly by clicking a link. The project also promises to provide an interactive learning experience for WordPress documentation to help new developers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Opening new doors for WordPress is also on the project&#8217;s roadmap, for the creation of tools that run across multiple devices. WordPress Playground removes limitations developers have lived with for years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s enable a new generation of WordPress tools running on desktops, mobile devices, in CLI, and inside web browsers,&#8221; Zieliński said. &#8220;Imagine WordPress as a cross-device note-taking app, or WooCommerce as a ticket-scanning app running on a phone, or a code editor running on a tablet where you can build WordPress extensions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;WordPress won over 40% of the web as an app that can only run on a server.

This new feature, designed to be an extensible quick search and command execution tool, was <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-15-6-introduces-experimental-details-block-and-command-center-for-site-editor\">introduced in Gutenberg 15.6</a>. In <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-16-0-introduces-page-management-in-the-site-editor\">version 16.0</a>, it came out of the experimental stage and <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/51169\">its API is now public</a>, ready for developers to create their own custom commands.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />image credit: <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/48457#issuecomment-1487439383\">Command Center mockups</a> &#8211; Gutenberg repository\n\n\n\n<p>The Command Center is on track to land in the upcoming WordPress 6.3 release but may be arriving under a different name. Automattic-sponsored contributor Reyes Martínez opened the discussion and identified three main purposes the feature is meant to serve: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Quickly search, navigate, and switch between different types of content</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Run commands to perform tasks or actions</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Extend and customize the tool, also with AI, via third parties (plugins)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The concept of a command center can convey the idea of a centralized location to execute commands and manage tasks, but it seems a bit technical and carries some militant connotations,&#8221; Martínez said. &#8220;Additionally, after reading some <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/05/17/command-center-request-for-feedback/\">feedback left in Riad’s call for feedback</a>, my impression (from a marketing perspective) is that this name may not fully convey its potential and different use cases.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Martínez contends that &#8220;Wayfinder&#8221; as a name &#8220;better captures its different use cases&#8221; and &#8220;reflects benefits, and appeals to a less technical audience.&#8221; She also suggested that it &#8220;has the potential to evoke a sense of curiosity, exploration, and discovery in more types of users.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two Automattic-sponsored contributors responded with support for Wayfinder as the name shortly after the discussion was posted. Nearly every other participant has highlighted concerns about using Wayfinder and suggested other names that more clearly describe the feature. The term does not have a direct translation in many languages and leans heavily towards navigation, leaving out the other purposes the feature is meant to serve, such as running commands and actions, as well as AI and other third-party integrations.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I\'m not sure I could articulate why I feel so strong about the naming of the command bar coming to the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WordPress?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#WordPress</a> Site Editor (and eventually the whole Dashboard <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f91e-1f3fd.png\" alt=\"🤞🏽\" class=\"wp-smiley\" />) in a tweet, but wow I have strong feelings. <a href=\"https://t.co/yP4dx1LEDl\">https://t.co/yP4dx1LEDl</a></p>&mdash; Aurooba Ahmed (@aurooba) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aurooba/status/1670800659837321217?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 19, 2023</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s two things here. One is &#8216;What is it?&#8217; and the other is &#8216;What is it called?\'&#8221;  WP Engine developer Ross Wintle said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I would rather it was just called a command palette on both counts. This is by far the most common term in use to describe this kind of thing. I see no need to stray from popular convention. Anything else is either confusing or marketing and I don&#8217;t like either.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He suggests WordPress adopt the term based on its well-documented use throughout the industry for similar features in apps like Sublime Text, VS Code, GitHub, Jira, and others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We did hear Matías call it <a href=\"https://youtu.be/7Nmz3IjtPh0?t=911\">a &#8220;Wayfinder tool&#8221; in the WordCamp Europe 2023 Keynote</a>, so at this point perhaps making arguments for it to be called something else <em>may</em> be moot, I&#8217;m not sure,&#8221; WordPress developer Aurooba Ahmed said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;However, I was curious about the argument that a term using the word <code>command</code> would be less appealing to non-developers, so I wanted to document names around the internet for command palettes that I&#8217;ve seen in non-developer tools/services (to augment <a href=\"https://github.com/rosswintle\">@rosswintle</a>&#8216;s documenting of tools and what they call this feature as well). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ahmed cited apps using &#8220;Command Palette,&#8221; including Miro, Reflect, and Obsidian. Another common name for this feature is &#8220;Command Menu,&#8221; used by Todoist and Cron. She also cited ClickUp as using &#8220;Command Center&#8221; and Missive using &#8220;Command Bar,&#8221; among other apps with similar terms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s more, these are just the ones I could think of, off the top of my head,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;m not sure I consider the argument that a name with the term <code>Command</code> would be less appealing to non-developers a very strong one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not to say that WordPress shouldn&#8217;t choose a different or unique name for this feature. However, then at this point I&#8217;m wondering what <em>kind</em> of name is wanted: one that feels new and different or one that clearly communicates its purpose and easy to remember?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Those ideas don&#8217;t have to be mutually exclusive, but going <em>against</em> a fairly internet-wide informally established naming convention and understanding of a certain feature should have a solid reason behind it.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Automattic-sponsored contributor Nicholas Garofalo noted that the name itself will not be prominently featured in the interface, based on <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/48457#issuecomment-1487439383\">recent mockups</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The name, like Gutenberg, will be used primarily for marketing and documentation,&#8221; Garofolo said. &#8220;That influences naming and translation concerns.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Even differences in US vs UK English make it extremely difficult to find a catchy (Ie. marketable) and universally understood (Ie. easily documented) name. That&#8217;s why I agree with the aforementioned recommendation that we treat this a bit like &#8216;Gutenberg&#8217; or &#8216;plugin.&#8217; If this were appearing frequently within the interface then I would perhaps feel different.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other suggestions from speakers of different languages include Actions hub, Finder, Quick commands, Quick actions, and Quick finder. Even if Gutenberg contributors are determined to emphasize the navigation aspect of the feature at the expense of its other capabilities, a term like Quick finder is more easily understood for the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/stats/\">52% of WordPress users</a> who use the software in a language other than English.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The term &#8216;Wayfinder&#8217; is very much associated with navigation and not with taking actions or giving commands,&#8221; WordPress developer Ian Svoboda said. &#8220;This feature’s purpose is to make it easier to run commands and move about the dashboard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;A term like Wayfinder feels like marketing speak more than an actual feature name. Consider the difference between saying: &#8216;use the Wayfinder&#8217; and &#8216;use the command palette.&#8217; In the later example, the meaning and purpose is immediately clear.

This major shift opens the door for more experimentation through varied formats. In a recent <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2023/06/19/next-generation-of-wordpress-events-updates/\">update</a>, the team shared that progress on the discussions has generated 64 ideas with 59 organizers who are willing to follow up on their ideas. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are also eight pilot events that have been confirmed and six of them will launch in 2023. These include some of the most creative concepts that WordPress has ever officially entertained, as the previous WordCamp format had become predictable and requirements somewhat inflexible. These pilot events offer a glimpse of what events could look like going forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The WordPress community in Leipzig, Germany, is planning the first ever Low-Cost WordCamp for July 1, 2023. Organizers will host 90 attendees and keep costs low with no swag, no social dinner, and no after party. They will offer just one track of presentations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The goal is to motivate and help new and veteran organizers to create a lighter, impactful event that is low cost and requires less time, financial resources, and fewer organizers/volunteers,&#8221;  Automattic-sponsored Community Team contributor Isotta Peira said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contributors in Sevilla, Spain, are planning a &#8220;WordPress Day&#8221; on July 2, 2023, where the focus will be engaging 50 attendees in three different areas of contribution. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The goal is to bring new contributors to the community and retain them by organizing multiple events every year,&#8221; Peira said. With these small numbers and limited goals, this effort could easily be organized as frequently as they anticipate. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The community in Tegal, Indonesia is planning a &#8220;Scale Up&#8221; Workshop for October 22, 2023. A group of 50 participants will join in a 1-day training event that will expand their WordPress skills by &#8220;diving into the world of WordPress for enterprise.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The three other approved pilot events for 2023 include a Rural event for small towns/villages, a WP for Publishers in Bangalore, and a Community Day in Rome, Italy, designed for WordPress community organizers, scheduled for September 29.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of the confirmed events fall within the new purpose for WordPress events that the Community Team identified earlier this year:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>WordPress events spark innovation and adoption by way of accessible training and networking for users, builders, designers, and extenders. We celebrate community by accelerating 21st-century skills, professional opportunities, and partnerships for WordPressers of today and tomorrow.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Prospective event organizers who are inspired by the confirmed pilot events can submit their creative ideas via a <a href=\"https://wordpressdotorg.survey.fm/next-generation-of-wordpress-events\">dedicated form</a>. The Community Team is still accepting pilot events for 2023 and is also scheduling into 2024.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 19 Jun 2023 21:11:46 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:41;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:76:\"WordPress.org blog: WP Briefing: Episode 58: A New Wave for WordPress Events\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?post_type=podcast&p=15179\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:78:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2023/06/episode-58-a-new-wave-for-wordpress-events/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:15635:\"<p>Join WordPress guest host, Chief of Staff and Head of Operations, Chloé Bringmann, and special guest Head of Programs and Contributor Experience, Angela Jin, in the 58th episode of the WordPress Briefing as they discuss the next generation of WordCamps.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Credits</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group is-content-justification-left is-layout-constrained wp-container-1 wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<ul>\n<li>Guest Host:&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/cbringmann/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Chloé Bringmann</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Guest:&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/angelasjin/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Angela Jin</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Editor:&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/dustinhartzler/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Dustin Hartzler</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Logo:&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/javiarce/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Javier Arce</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Production:&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/bjmcsherry/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Brett McSherry</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Song: Fearless First by Kevin MacLeod</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Show Notes</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2023/06/twenty-years-of-wordpress-at-wceu/\">WordCamp Europe 2023 Keynote</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Establishment of a formal WordPress&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/project/2023/05/30/proposal-establishment-of-a-formal-wordpress-sustainability-team/\" target=\"_blank\">Sustainability Team</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li>WordPress 6.4&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/06/05/wordpress-6-4-development-cycle/\" target=\"_blank\">Development Cycle Announced</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li>WCUS &#8211; Still looking <a href=\"https://us.wordcamp.org/2023/call-for-volunteers/\">for volunteers</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2023/05/08/the-next-generation-of-wordcamps/\">The Next Generation of WordCamps</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2023/05/24/idea-generation-next-gen-wordcamps/\">Idea generation: Next Gen WordCamps!</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2023/06/06/discussion-next-generation-event-tooling/\">Discussion: Next Generation Event Tooling</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2023/06/twenty-years-of-wordpress-at-wceu/\">Twenty Years of WordPress at WCEU</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/handbook/\">Contributor Handbook</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Transcript</h2>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-15179\"></span>\n\n\n\n<p>(Intro music)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Chloé Bringmann 00:00:10]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hello, everyone, and welcome to the WordPress Briefing, the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project, some insight into the community that supports it, and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your guest host Chloé Bringmann. And here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>(Intro music)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Chloé Bringmann 00:00:40]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I have the privilege of guest hosting this episode of the WordPress Briefing. And today I have with me a very special guest. The Head of Programs and Contributor Experience, Angela Jin. Welcome. Before we dive into all the questions, can you tell me and our listeners a little bit about your role in the WordPress community?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:01:01]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, happy to, and thank you so much for having me. I&#8217;m very excited to be here. I am the Head of Programs and Contributor Experience, and I provide oversight and guidance for our WordPress programs, such as our events programs, training, and Five for the Future, with an eye toward ensuring their sustainability and growth. I&#8217;m very fortunate to work with our contributors across many teams around the world. In addition to troubleshooting and helping folks figure out how to move forward, I also spend a good amount of time exploring with others what could be in our programs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Chloé Bringmann 00:01:41]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We just got back from WordCamp Europe in Athens, Greece. It was such an energizing event for me, but I&#8217;m curious about what your impressions were of the past week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:01:52]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, it was fantastic. I&#8217;m always really inspired by what a group of like-minded people can achieve together. There&#8217;s a lot of passion for this particular WordCamp, and it made for a really wonderful WordPress experience. Full of lots of great connections and memories; I have a million follow-ups and probably even more thoughts to reflect on. So it&#8217;s great. There were a lot of new WordPressers there. So it was lovely to meet them. And I&#8217;m really excited to see how many exciting new projects and ideas that we have in the space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Chloé Bringmann 00:02:27]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Same, you said it perfectly. Josepha also mentioned in the flagship’s keynote, the proposal for the next generation of WordCamps. I&#8217;m curious about what the main ideas and goals, as discussed thus far, are of that proposal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:02:42]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For sure. So WordCamps have been fundamental for the WordPress community for a very long time. And while they have continued to grow larger and reach more places around the world, it&#8217;s also undeniable that the way that people meet has changed since 2006.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:03:01]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, just as WordPress itself iterates we&#8217;re looking at iterating on WordCamps so that they move from fundamental to indispensable for the WordPressers of today and tomorrow. So event attendees today are looking to learn essential skills, make connections that lead to neat opportunities, and more.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:03:23]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So to that end, we put forth an updated purpose for our events, which is that WordPress events spark innovation and adoption by way of accessible training and networking for users, builders, designers, and extenders. We celebrate community by accelerating 21st-century skills, professional opportunities, and partnerships for WordPressers of today and tomorrow.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:03:47]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the goal here is to create events that are more clearly defined &#8211; who these are for what you will gain from attending. We are looking to see events that take a deeper dive into content, or topics and provide more advanced content. And let&#8217;s try out some different formats and see how that shapes our event experience. And so it is a big shift. And change is always hard.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:04:13]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the feedback that I&#8217;ve gotten so far, and certainly at WordCamp Europe, is that this is a very welcome evolution. And the Community team has already received over 60 proposals. So I&#8217;m very excited about that. In fact, a WordPress Community Day in Rome has already been announced and is focused on providing meet-up organizing and community management skills. So that&#8217;s pretty cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;[Chloé Bringmann 00:04:37]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wow, that&#8217;s incredible. I love that we&#8217;ve gotten 60 suggestions already and that we already have an event in place. That&#8217;s fantastic. In that blog post, too, it&#8217;s mentioned that WordCamps should prioritize inclusivity and diversity. How can organizers ensure these values are upheld in the next generation of WordCamps and beyond events? Into our day-to-day project involvement?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:05:04]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Excellent question. So while WordCamps themselves are changing, some of our core values, like prioritizing inclusivity and diversity, are non-negotiable. For the whole project, we have a diversity, equity, and inclusion statement, and a Code of Conduct that lays out how we expect our community to engage with each other in this space.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:05:27]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And on top of that, our programs do focus on providing resources and training like how to create a diverse speaker roster. And we have diverse speaker training workshops on how to organize a diverse and inclusive WordPress event. And we also have a great list of third-party resources as well. And so, with so many events, we create a lot of opportunities to grow as a visible contributor, whether it is a speaker, a volunteer, or an organizer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:05:56]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so with the next generation of events, we could more intentionally create these spaces for groups that historically have been underrepresented. Even long before my post went live, the BlackPress meetup group, for example, wanted to create an event that connected with historically black colleges and universities. And an event like that that really invites a specific group to learn all about WordPress would be a really great experience and a wonderful way to celebrate that community and a great connection to the broader community so that we can intentionally get to the diversity that we want to see.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:06:38]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I also want to add that the people who are underrepresented in our community are more likely to need financial sponsorship. And so even though we do keep our ticket prices low so that our events are more easily accessible, the cost of travel continues to increase, not to mention the time and energy required to participate in these events. So an excellent way that companies can help is to sponsor somebody&#8217;s time and somebody&#8217;s contributions, which we&#8217;re always trying to encourage through the Five for the Future program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Chloé Bringmann 00:07:11]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beautiful. So, with that in mind, how do you foresee the next generation of WordCamps impacting the WordPress community, that larger ecosystem? So, what changes do you hope to see regarding community engagement, learning opportunities, and best practices?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:07:31]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I foresee us evolving our tried and true event format into a dynamic wealth of community-led opportunities. I know that online events were pretty exhausting during the worst of the pandemic, but there is a ton of unexplored opportunities there. And community research is also showing that online is a great way to create more inclusive and diverse events.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:07:58]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Training team, with their learn WordPress online workshops, have really led the way with our online events. And there are so many more people that we can reach there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:08:08]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so in addition to providing more advanced content, I also hope to see content around broader tech and business trends that influence WordPress, and conversely, how WordPress can shape those trends as well. And with all of that, I really hope that we can bring in more community members that otherwise wouldn&#8217;t be interested in what we currently offer, especially a younger generation that will help us drive the next generation of WordPress, the open source project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Chloé Bringmann 00:08:39]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Very excited to hear all of this, and I bet our listeners are too. I&#8217;m curious how they and community members can provide feedback or get involved with this next generation of WordCamps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:08:50]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m going to encourage everyone, please come chat with the Community team and comment on the current posts. We really welcome your feedback to help us get our events to this next iteration of what they will become. There are two posts, in particular, one is to suggest ideas of event formats and topics that you would like to see. And the second is if you are an organizer, we&#8217;re inviting you to hear some recommendations for improved tooling that would be helpful for your event site. And we&#8217;ll include links to those posts in the show notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Chloé Bringmann 00:09:26]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One final question for you, Angela. Any thoughts as we prepare for WordCamp US and the Community Summit, which will be in National Harbor, Maryland, in August?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:09:37]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the Community Summit in particular, if you want to attend and you haven&#8217;t already applied, please please do make sure to apply as soon as possible. And encourage somebody else who you think should attend to apply as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:09:53]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if financial constraints are a blocker, we are aiming to help with the cost of hotel and or flight. And so one way to help support the diversity and inclusion of this event, and really to the whole project, is to also contribute to the Community Summit travel fund. You can find information about all of that on the Community Summit site.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:10:15]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And next, if you have a topic in mind that you think needs to be discussed at the Community Summit, please please also share that information with us as well. And last but not least, I am, I am so excited. I&#8217;m not going to spoil anything. But I have been working with the WordCamp US organizing team and looking at some of what they have planned and some of the content. It&#8217;s going to be a truly incredible event, so don&#8217;t miss out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Chloé Bringmann 00:010:41]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, wonderful. Thank you so much for joining me, Angela. And I can&#8217;t wait to see you and the WordPress community in August in person.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Chloé Bringmann 00:010:58]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which brings us now to our small list of big things. First up is the proposal and establishment of a new WordPress contributor team, the Sustainability team. Coming into WordCamp Europe, a proposal was put forward to create a team that would embed sustainable practices and processes in the ecosystem to ensure the Project&#8217;s longevity, both socially, economically, and as well environmentally. At WordCamp Europe, this proposal was confirmed, and the Sustainability team is now officially the 22nd contributor team that WordPressers can support with their contributions. Head on over to their making WordPress Slack channel, #sustainability, and join the conversation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Chloé Bringmann 00:011:39]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, I would like to call your attention to the 6.4 development cycle post that was published on June 5th. 6.4 will be the third major release of 2023 and supports our diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts by being led by those contributors that identify as underrepresented gender. This release will also be the first to kick off phase three of the Gutenberg roadmap, which is collaborative editing and workflows. I&#8217;ve included a link to the post in our show notes and encourage anyone who is interested in being part of this momentous release to join us in making this both impactful and meaningful.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Chloé Bringmann 00:012:16]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, WordCamp US, as discussed, will be upon us before we know it starting on August 24th at National Harbor, Maryland. While tickets may be sold out, volunteers are still very much needed to make the flagship event run smoothly. So stop by us.wordcamp.org, raise your hand, and join us in August for engagement, inspiration, and learning. And that, my friends, is your small list of big things. I&#8217;m your guest host Chloé Bringmann and thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 19 Jun 2023 13:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Brett McSherry\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:42;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:62:\"Do The Woo Community: Where in the World are the WordPressers?\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=75298\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"https://dothewoo.io/where-in-the-world-are-the-wordpressers/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:355:\"<p>Marcus Burnette has an ongoing project that maps out the WordPress community. </p>\n<p>&gt;&gt; The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dothewoo.io/where-in-the-world-are-the-wordpressers/\">Where in the World are the WordPressers?</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dothewoo.io\">Do the Woo - a WooCommerce Builder Community</a>	.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 19 Jun 2023 09:08:27 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:43;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:111:\"Gutenberg Times: Gutenberg Changelog #84 – Gutenberg 15.9 and 16.0, Developer Blog Updates, and WordPress 6.3\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/?post_type=podcast&p=24495\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:96:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/podcast/gutenberg-changelog-84-gutenberg-15-9-and-16-0-wordpress-6-3/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:64786:\"<p>Isabel Brison and Birgit Pauli-Haack discuss Gutenberg 15.9 and 16.0, New Posts on the Developer Blog and the WordPress 6.3 release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/podcast/gutenberg-changelog-84-gutenberg-15-9-and-16-0-wordpress-6-3/#shownotes\">Show Notes</a> / <a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/podcast/gutenberg-changelog-84-gutenberg-15-9-and-16-0-wordpress-6-3/#transcript\">Transcript</a></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Music:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/xirclebox\">Homer Gaines</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Editor:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sandy-reed/\">Sandy Reed</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Logo:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://markuraine.com/\">Mark Uraine</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Production:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://icodeforapurpose.com\">Birgit Pauli-Haack</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-larger-font-size\"></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/live-q-a-layout-layout-layout/\"><strong>Live Q &amp; A: Layout.

In today&#8217;s show, we will talk about Gutenberg 15.9 and 6.0 releases, new posts from the developer block, the roadmap for 6.3 and a little bit of WordCamp Europe. I&#8217;m your host, Birgit Pauli-Haack, curator at the Gutenberg Times and the WordPress developer advocate and a full-time core contributor to the WordPress open source project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I have the wonderful pleasure to have Isabel Brison with me on the show. And Isabel has been a designer, developer on the Block Editor for almost four years, I think. And is the editor tech co-lead for WordPress 6.3, and therefore knows quite a bit about the features coming to WordPress 6.3. Isabel, thank you so much for making the time today to be on the show.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Oh, it&#8217;s a great pleasure. Thanks for inviting me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: We are both on the 6.3 release squad. So you are the tech colleague for the editor, together with Ramon Dodd. I&#8217;m on the team of editor triage with Nick Diego, Anne McCarthy and Firoz Sabaliya. Both of us, Firoz and I, are first-timers on this release squad, team four editor triage. So that&#8217;s going to be interesting. And we are less than two weeks before beta one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: We are indeed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: What&#8217;s happening in a release cycle before beta one and what after?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: So right now, from an editor tech lead perspective, what happens before beta one is we need to make sure that all the latest changes from Gutenberg plugin, so more than from the plugin itself, from the Gutenberg repo where all the cutting-edge stuff is being worked on. All those changes have to be transported into the core repo, which is a different repository.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So part of that process is automated. I say all the changes, but in reality, it&#8217;s all the changes that are stable enough to make it into core. Because in Gutenberg, there&#8217;s a lot of experimental stuff that is not necessarily ready for core yet. And so part of the process is that the editor tech lead, in this case, the leads, because there are two of us, we have to make sure that the right changes are being put into core, that everything is working well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Part of that process is you can say automated because essentially, in Gutenberg, you have a lot of JavaScript which is published as NPM packages and/or consumes those packages. So that part of the process is you update the packages, you publish the packages, the latest versions. And then we update the packages in the core repo to get those latest versions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, there&#8217;s also a fair amount of PHP in Gutenberg, and that part needs to be transported across to the other repo manually. And so that&#8217;s where we have to go through all the changes that require adding PHP to core and do pull requests for each change set and review them and commit them individually. So depending on how many changes, and we&#8217;re talking&#8230; So Gutenberg has been growing a fair bit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have a lot of contributors now, and so there&#8217;s a lot of changes in each release. And so this process can become a bit overwhelming if there&#8217;s a lot of stuff. And now we&#8217;re counting down to beta and going, &#8220;Oh, we need to get all the back ports in, in time before beta and in time, preferably, to be able to test them a bit in core and check everything&#8217;s okay before beta&#8217;s cut.&#8221; So that&#8217;s the path of the process that we&#8217;re at now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So there&#8217;s a lot of shifting around and talking to contributors and testing as well maybe beforehand. Is there also a process to audit some of the experimental APIs that are there if they can be made stable?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Because that was one of the contentions that sometimes experimental stuff gets into core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: So that&#8217;s also something that occurs before each release. There&#8217;ll be an audit in Gutenberg of all the experimental APIs. So this is interesting. This situation of the experimental APIs has evolved a bit over time. So previously, up until, I want to say maybe a year ago, but I have a very, very hazy sense of time. So it might be more or less.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There were a lot of experimental APIs that would be merged into core because they were part of a Gutenberg feature that was considered stable enough. The feature itself was considered stable enough to move into core, although the API had not been marked stable. And so in practice, there&#8217;s a fair few experimental APIs that are public. And because they have made it into core at some point in the past, we now have to support them indefinitely because there are extenders out there using them in the real world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we can&#8217;t scrap them, we can&#8217;t make changes to them. And so essentially, they are stable but there&#8217;s a lot of them. And there&#8217;s some progress, slow progress in marking things stable for each release but we have to go through a lot of APIs. So every time before the release, I feel like this work should be done maybe a bit more in advance as opposed to being a month earlier or three weeks before beta.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because by that time, everyone&#8217;s just super busy with, &#8220;Oh, but we need to get this feature finished and we need to make sure this is working. We need to fix all these bugs to make sure that this feature&#8217;s stable enough to make it into core.&#8221; And at that point in time, no one is concerned about whether the APIs are marked experimental or not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the good improvement that we had a while ago was that a new system was introduced into Gutenberg that allows us to export experimental APIs as private. And so that means from a package, there&#8217;s a bunch of private APIs. And they can be used in another package, but they are not made available to the general public. And that makes it safer to have these APIs be experimental for a while longer and be able to make changes to them without having to provide the indefinite back compatibility for something that we, at some point, realized was not the right API.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this is all work in progress. So I did that audit recently, and what I noticed is that there are not that many. Now that we have this mechanism that allows us to mark APIs private, we&#8217;re not actually putting any new experimental APIs into core. The ones that are already there, though that&#8217;s another matter, we progressively stabilized. But it is definitely a work in progress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: That&#8217;s awesome. And I think for the show notes, there was a process and that was proposed at the Make blog a while ago. You&#8217;re right, I think it was almost a year ago. And I have the feeling that about three or four months ago, Adam Zelensky, who was one of the drivers of this new feature or new method on how to handle experimental APIs now, he has published a progress report on how that&#8217;s working now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So for the listeners who are interested into getting really into the nitty-gritty of it, that is definitely two posts for you to read. So now just for the people that don&#8217;t know you, you have been a guest on Gutenberg Times Live Q&amp;A in January, and you were talking about layouts. How is the work progressing? And how was your talk at WordCamp Asia? So I&#8217;m just getting some of our listeners caught up with you and what happened.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: That seems like an eternity ago, WordCamp Asia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Don&#8217;t I know it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Back in February. Yeah, it was. And so what happened is, layout is progressing slowly. So there are a few small enhancements that are going to be going into core 6.3. One of the things that I actually just merged this PR earlier, which is to stabilize the layout support. So the layout was one of those experimental APIs that have been in core for a while.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And because they have been there for a while and they&#8217;re actually being used in production by a few plugins, they are de facto stable because we do have to provide that compatibility for them. So it becomes absurd at that point to still have the API marked experimental. So layout has just been stabilized. I guess that&#8217;s the big news.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It doesn&#8217;t mean anything in terms of features. Literally, it&#8217;s just the tag. The experimental tag is no longer there. I hope that going forward, this is going to give folks more confidence that they can use layout in third party extensions and it works. It would&#8217;ve worked anyway because we did have to provide those assurances already. But it&#8217;s good to have it officially stable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yes. Congratulations, so to speak.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: You were also talking about working on the grid layouts. I have seen there are still experiments. Well, now that you are part of the release cycle there until the release, you probably are not going to be able to work on that. So do you think that&#8217;s going to get into 6.4 or that it&#8217;s progressing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: So that&#8217;s a good question. So grid layout. So what happens is a new layout has been created, it&#8217;s available. So through the layout API that is no longer experimental, anyone can now use a layout add. So add layout support to a block. Say you&#8217;re building a custom block, you can add layout support to it and you can make that layout be of type grid. So that is already available in the plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And what is marked experimental, and will not be shipped in 6.3, is the group grid variation. So the group block has a few different layout variations, and behind an experimental flag in the plugin, there is a grid variation for the group block. However, that hasn&#8217;t been marked stable yet because what we have currently, the grid layout is a very basic version. It&#8217;s a very basic type of layout.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a lot of features to grid, there are a lot of very interesting and good thoughts out there about how we can build on it and create awesome tools so people can build really cool grid layouts. However, we only really have that basic structure that gives you a grid layout without any real possibility of configuring for the child lock. So if you want them to occupy one space in the grid, two or three, which is what really gives grid all of its flexibility, is that ability to manipulate and decide where the children are going to sit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So for now, that group grid variation is not going to ship, but grid is actually going to ship in the post template block as a layout variation for post template. So we previously had in the query block the command&#8230; The controls are actually in the query block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you could choose between a list or a grid layout type of query. But what those controls were doing were actually setting a kind of custom layout in the post template block. And because it was a custom implementation, there was no possibility to add a block space and control to it. And because people really need to have the ability to change block spacing and post template, we did the refactor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now post template is using actual layout support, so block spacing can be set on it. And so behind the scenes, it still has the custom toolbar control where you can choose between a list or a grid type layout. So the exposure of actual grid layout controls is kind of limited, but it is using grids. So technically, yes, there is one lot that is shipping with grid layout in 6.3.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Excellent. Well, that was the catch-up with Isabel Brison on the layout. So thank you so much. So let&#8217;s go a little bit further into our show here today.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Announcements</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We have another announcement. Since the last Gutenberg Changelog, there were five new posts on the developer block. And one was just published this week that&#8217;s, &#8220;What&#8217;s New for Developers?&#8221; by Justin Tadlock. And that&#8217;s the fifth installment of the monthly roundup showcasing features that are specific for theme and plugin developers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it focused a little bit on the 6.3 development cycle. It&#8217;s more like you can test it now, so your plugin and your theme will be compatible when 6.3 comes out, or just make sure that it doesn&#8217;t break kind of list. But it has a lot more other things in there. Ryan Welcher published a tutorial on how to use the block inspector sidebar groups that came in with 6.2.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now, as a developer, you have more control over the custom controls that should be appearing in the&#8230; Inspector controls are what&#8217;s showing in the sidebar, just to place that in the canvas where you see all those custom controls. So if you want to, as a plugin developer, add additional controls to, say, the dimensions, you can group the interface for that to show up in the style tab, in the dimension block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And he has some nice code examples in there. Justin Tadlock also published customizing core block style variations in theme.json. And it&#8217;s a walkthrough through the block styles directly in theme.json. Instead of using them in a custom style sheet, you can centralize all the things a little bit more in the theme.json. Curating the editor experience with client-side filters, post by Nick Diego, shows off also the new filters that were introduced in 6.2 and how you can change the editor experience with new client-side JavaScript filters, and has some great examples there for your block development.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then lastly, the first one is useentityrecords hook as an easier way to fetch WordPress data, by Michael Burridge. And it&#8217;s part out of the WordPress data package and core data packages. And the hook has been extremely useful to fetching and working with data in your block development.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this tutorial shows you how it&#8217;s easier to use entity records instead of the getEntityRecords from the data package. This only is for developers of course, it&#8217;s to develop a new block. So it won&#8217;t help anybody who is a no-coder. But you know that you can curate the editor experience or your developer can curate the editor experience. It&#8217;s something that you can, as a project manager, definitely learn more about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Good stuff. There&#8217;s a lot of features here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: We&#8217;re all catching up on quite a few things to make it easier to do block development, and the theme development and also augment the dev notes that certainly talked about the new groups for the inspector controls or through the client-side filters but not as deeply enough. Sometimes it&#8217;s really hard to get the exact use case, or if you don&#8217;t have examples for various use cases, to get it into an idea and how to use it in your project.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What’s Released &#8211; Gutenberg 15.9</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So that brings us to what&#8217;s released. Then we are tackling first the Gutenberg 15.9 release that&#8217;s from May 31st, by about two weeks ago. And it included 171 PRs merged into this release from 58 contributors. Seven of them were first-timers, and Carlos Bravo was a release lead and author of the release post. So let&#8217;s dive in.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Enhancements</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are enhancements that you can now have block variations transformations in the block switcher. So what does that mean? It means that when you have the inserter and you want to do a transform, you can also offer the block variations from it, if I understood this correctly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: The block switcher is in the block toolbar, correct? It&#8217;s in the block toolbar. When you click on the block icon, you get a list of the possible transforms. So apart from other blocks that you can transform the block to, you would get variations of the same block also as possible transformations, which I feel existed at some point in the past and then was removed. And that has been re-added. I&#8217;m not sure. I might be wrong on this. I just have a vague feeling that this is familiar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, it sounds really familiar. I don&#8217;t know if it actually includes the styles as well. Because the styles are on the right-hand side and you have to now&#8230; But it doesn&#8217;t. So it&#8217;s the block variations because the blocks&#8217; variation have other names. But they were actually organized in the transformations further down with the prioritization. You probably can get them higher up in the block switcher. So this is definitely something I would support even if it went back and come back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Yeah, makes it easy. And you get style variations too for blocks that have style variations. This is actually pretty neat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And you don&#8217;t have to open up the site, but to just get the style variations in there. Next thing up would be that the code block now has wide align support. And that is really good because sometimes the line in a code block is creating horizontal navigation bars, horizontal scroll bars. And now, with the wide support, you can make it a little wider and have that one line not remove the horizontal scroll bar, which is a better reading experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Yeah, that&#8217;s a good aesthetic improvement too. It can be nice to have wide code windows so you can read the whole thing in one go without having to scroll.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Do you want to take the next one?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: What&#8217;s the next one? I wanted to mention that in 5.9 a PR was merged that removed the post content block from the list of blocks that can be inserted in the post editor. And that makes sense because the post editor is basically what we get inside the post content block. So if you tried to add a post content block to the post editor, it was getting an error, which was a really bad user experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so the block was rightfully removed. But in the meantime, someone noticed that there was a possible use case for the post content in the post editor because we can add query blocks in the post editor. So inside your post, you could have a little query with some categories or something like that. And there is a legitimate use case for having the post content block sit inside the query, and so inside the post template that you have inside the query.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because if you have short posts, if you have a custom post type that&#8217;s fairly short, you might want to actually show the whole post in there. And so a PR was quickly done to fix this and allow for that use case. I don&#8217;t think it went into&#8230; It didn&#8217;t. No.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: It did.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: For sure, it didn&#8217;t go into 16.0.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I think it did.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: It is going to go out into&#8230; It did? I&#8217;m pretty sure that it was only merged yesterday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Oh, okay. And it didn&#8217;t-</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: No.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: &#8230; It wasn&#8217;t backported. No. So it will come back for 16.1.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: So in 16.1, we will be able to use post content inside queries inside the post editor, which is pretty cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: One other use case is from a different custom post types, you want to show some of the posts in there and in your blog post. And there are many use cases I can think of it when you wanted to query something else and need to post content in there. So the next one is the Wayfinder or Command. I think there&#8217;s still a discussion going on on the naming of the feature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wayfinder was also not the one that was&#8230; It feels right for me, but I&#8217;m kind of English Westerners. But in the eastern hemisphere, it was a little bit differently seen. And for translated, it was really hard to find a good way. So the discussion goes on. But in the meantime, the Command&#8217;s API has marked in public, so you can use it and test it for your plugin or your WordPress install.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And Riad Benguella&#8217;s post Command Center request for feedback also contains some code examples on how to use the API. And you can create static commands, dynamic commands or contextual commands. And so you can try it out and see what it all does for you. It&#8217;s like a search bar that you don&#8217;t have to go through. You click control K, and then a search bar comes up on the interface and then you can type in some search commands. And it gives you a list of items that you can do, like add page or add post or something like that. Have you played with it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: It&#8217;s really cool. It kind of reminds me of the Spotlight on the Mac. I don&#8217;t know if Spotlight is the best name for it, but in my head, I&#8217;m calling it Spotlight. Because basically, it just pops up, this bar in the middle, and you can search for stuff and you can do stuff from it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is great. I wanted to add that I think possibly also in 5.9, there was a PR that added the ability to invoke the Command Center by clicking on the template name at the top of the site editor. So that&#8217;s just another super practical shortcut.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, 15.9. So what else is in there? The interactivity API is still in experiments. And do you want to talk about the lightbox and the directives?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Yeah. I thought I&#8217;d mentioned it because it&#8217;s super exciting. It&#8217;s still very, very experimental. At this stage, it is unlikely to make it into 6.3, which on one hand, I&#8217;m slightly sad because lightboxes for images are really cool. On the other hand, it is still behind an experimental flag in the plugin. It hasn&#8217;t actually seen a lot of real-world testing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s also good to get some testing done before actually merging the feature into core. It&#8217;s very new, it&#8217;s very promising. So the whole interactivity API is a really interesting piece that&#8217;s been worked on for ages. It seems like ages. I don&#8217;t know. It can&#8217;t be that long. But I&#8217;m so excited about it because it provides a really neat way of adding interactive behaviors that&#8217;s usually only achievable with JavaScript to playing blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so it&#8217;s going to add a bunch of behaviors out of the box for core blocks, but it&#8217;s also going to be possible to use that API in the future to create custom behaviors for custom blocks. So it&#8217;s just a really nice way of standardizing a way of adding JavaScript to blocks to create dynamic behaviors. And the first experimental one or the first experiments to be put out there in the plugin is the possibility to add a lightbox to images. So if you enable it, you can click on the image in the front-end and then the image just pops up in full screen kind of thing, which is pretty neat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And I know that Luis Herranz did a workshop at WordCamp Europe last week. There was quite some buzz around the interactivity API. Because it mostly is also in the PHP render file where you can just add the directives or add the call for the directives. So it gets a lot of PHP developers also excited about block development and adding the interactivity to them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the excitement is also around being able&#8230; which is not going to be in the first version, even if it makes it into 6.4, that you can actually create your own directives. So the core will come out with, I don&#8217;t know, 15 or 20 directives that have a lot of use cases, cover probably 80% what a developer would need.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the combination of it, be it data binding, be it button actions, being other interactivity. So this is a really exciting feature to come to block development. And I think it&#8217;s one of the missing links to get other people excited about building with blocks and JavaScript. And get the first vendor with PHP and then have the client-side changes through the API is really cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Yeah. Cool. My cat just popped in. Sorry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: The cat. So the next thing is that the text formatting tools in a paragraph have now two new attributes added. That&#8217;s the long language, so L-A-N-G, and the D-I-R, the dir attributes, which helps with multilingual posts. So you can add a language like French or Italian IT to a paragraph, and then a signal to the assistant technologies and the reader, &#8220;Okay, this is a different language.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the dir part is that you change left to right, right to left rendering of that. And the code, almost verbatim, is used from Jean-Baptiste Audras, who had a plugin that added those two formatting tools to the paragraph.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the subsequent PR also now uses the bidirectional text override element from Mozilla. But it&#8217;s good to have these additional formatting tools in there to cater to the multilingual content that you find all over Europe. So this is really cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Not only is this really cool, but I am fairly certain that this is a longstanding issue from the accessibility audit way back when that the last time I checked was still open. So it might be a good idea to go over there and see if that issue can now be closed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: But now it can be closed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Super exciting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: That was definitely a missing piece. And that was also the reason why Jean-Baptiste added that to his companies or that his company built the plugin to help their clients with that kind of formatting. So there is a new API to allow prioritization of inserter items.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a block list setting, you now can allow the parent blocks define the priority for the blocks that are allowed in it, and how the inserter displays them for the inner blocks of that parent block. So that is definitely another customization and curation tool for the extenders with their block development.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Oh, yeah. For sure. That will be great to provide more custom user experiences for certain block types. Definitely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I think we need to somewhere create a list of all the extension possibilities because I don&#8217;t think there is an overall list of all the possibilities on how to extend now. Sometimes there&#8217;s still missing documentation there of course. Not of course. But I found that some of the extensibilities like the inspector controls, the documentation&#8217;s in the README for the source code component but doesn&#8217;t bubble up into the developer handbook of the editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I know that Nick Diego and Ryan are working on that together with Michael to figure out this architecture of missing stuff. Next thing is it sounds really benign, renaming template parts to library. So in the side editor on the left-hand side, there was a menu item called template parts. And that will be renamed into library because it will also house reusable blocks and patterns, reusable patterns or sync patterns, I think they&#8217;re called.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The template parts, of course, will be also underneath it. I don&#8217;t know how far the syncing of pattern or reusable block is going because there&#8217;s a lot of confusion since the beginning: what is a pattern? What is a reusable block? And what is the template part? And they sound to be the same, but they all have one thing different of them. And there is an effort to unify it a little bit, and just manage what&#8217;s different instead of have three different items for them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: I think that that would be great because reusable blocks are essentially patterns or they were already working as patterns, although they have the block itself. When you create a reusable block, it&#8217;s frozen, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: If you make changes to it, you&#8217;re making changes to all reusable blocks to the content. Whereas patterns, you drop a pattern in somewhere and you make changes to it and you can continue using that pattern elsewhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: But yet there&#8217;s this big problem that when you have a pattern and you change the design of the pattern, you cannot go back and have that change as well on all the time all the uses that you had, because there is no record of a post using a pattern. Because once it&#8217;s in the canvas, it just is the blocks that are inside the patterns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Yeah. So I think the fundamental piece here is being able to have patterns where the design can be changed globally, even if the content of the pattern is individual to each instance. And it&#8217;s a pretty complex piece of work. It&#8217;s being actively worked on. There is, I think, an effort to consolidate reusable blocks and patterns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think the idea is going to be that reusable blocks are going to be absorbed and become patterns of a type. But it&#8217;s still fairly early stages considering the complexity of the endeavor. So at this point, it&#8217;s not certain what, if anything, of that work will actually make it into 6.3.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, I can see that. And because the reusable blocks have actually also an interface to edit them, which the patterns do not. And that&#8217;s also something: how can you make those editing interfaces be used for both of them? There are a lot of different things that need to be aligned differently to make it all work, and I think it&#8217;s a fairly complex thing. Yes, you&#8217;re right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the next part for 15.9 is that the global styles get revisions. And that has been on the feedback list and on the wish list of a lot of people who have participated in the Full Site Editing Outreach program and have been very faithful in doing all the testing, the calls for testing and having a revision.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because you know that when you change colors and font settings and things, you don&#8217;t know what you get until you see what you get. You don&#8217;t know what you want until you see what you get. And then all of a sudden, &#8220;Oh, maybe I liked that previously better.&#8221; But then you don&#8217;t remember the combination of what it was. And now you have revisions and you can see them side by side. So this is a very exciting new feature that will come in, and it seems to be making to 6.3.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Oh, yeah. That one has been merged and it&#8217;s definitely going to make it into 6.3.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: There might be UI changes, but it will show up in the styles right-hand side and the sidebar under revisions. And then you get a list of all the revisions in the canvas and you can see them all together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: So you can access the dark sidebar on the left-hand side. If you go to the styles and you see if the theme has style variations, they&#8217;ll appear there. But also in the right-hand side, global style sidebar, you can also access the revisions on the styles actions. There&#8217;s a little button at the top.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Experiments</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Excellent. Yes. Under the experiments of 15.9, there is a list items called the behaviors UI. And that&#8217;s part of the interactivity API, I believe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And that is kind of a standardized way to attach behavior to an element or something like that. As I said, it&#8217;s in the experiments and I think it&#8217;s part of the lightbox behavior. That&#8217;s the only behavior that&#8217;s available right now. But what else can you think about what this could do?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Yes, I believe so. So say that you can define certain types of interactivity for certain blocks as, for example, the image can have a lightbox, but we don&#8217;t want all images on the site to suddenly have lightboxes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so the behaviors UI is something that it provides website authors, users with a way of enabling those interactive behaviors or disabling them for any given block. So it&#8217;s an important piece because certain behaviors might not be applicable to all blocks on the site and you need to have a way of turning them on and off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And so that will be part of the advanced interface on a block-based level in the sidebar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Yeah. Currently, it sits under advanced in the block sidebar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Well, this concludes our changelog for 15.9.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Gutenberg 16.0</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>And now this week, 16.0 was released and Nick Diego was the release lead, and he wrote also the post. And it had 164 pull requests by 54 contributors. So it&#8217;s always a good size of contributors adding code to things. And there were four first-timers as well. And this comes with one feature we are all excited about. But do you want to take us into it, Isabel?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Yeah. So the feature that we&#8217;re all excited about, there&#8217;s actually a couple of features that we&#8217;re all excited about. One of them is the ability to add new pages from the site editor directly. Now a disclaimer, the ability is to add draft pages, not to publish them directly. But that&#8217;s great because the first thing that you do when you add pages, work on it is a draft, and then only afterwards you publish it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s good. It&#8217;s the start of being able to do everything, having the site editor as the center from which you can do anything to your site, including create pages, edit them possibly at some point in the future, publish them. So that&#8217;s a pretty great new feature to have. It can be accessed from the left-hand sidebar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: The new page also helps when you create new navigation menu where you want to access or point to a page that doesn&#8217;t exist yet. So this certainly helps as well. And I saw some discussion around it for that to work well and it show up in the list of searches that the page is actually published. So it&#8217;s the question, &#8220;What is a good way to move forward?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what I am really excited about is that I can now edit a page in its context and I see how it works in context of the template. So I see the header, I see the footer, I see if there is a sidebar and how my content behaves that I create for the page. It allows me. And I know from the feedback of the Full Site Editing program, there was quite some feedback that there is a confusion between, &#8220;Am I adding the page or am I adding the template?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And some people edited the template thinking it was a page, and then found that edited piece or that added piece on every single page because they inadvertently changed the template. So the possibility was taking out of the site editor, but it&#8217;s coming back now with some guardrails. So you know when you edit a template, all of a sudden, the title changes to page title instead of saying about us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it also highlights that you are editing now a template part instead of the page itself. So I think we are getting really closer to have more a unified system of editing and not having to switch out from the site editor to the post editor and back in the admin where you have multiple back steps to get to the old page editing screens. So I&#8217;m really excited about to get this all in one interface.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: So that&#8217;s the second feature, what I was saying when I said there were two features. New pages, but also the ability to be able to tell at a glance if what we&#8217;re editing is the page&#8217;s actual content or the page&#8217;s template. So now it&#8217;s only possible to either edit one or the other, but not both simultaneous setting. That&#8217;s a pretty good one to have in there because otherwise it would be extremely confusing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, absolutely. And then there were a few, I don&#8217;t want to say small changes because it definitely takes an effort to get it in. But the list view got two additional, I would say, quality of life changes, the dragging. So you can now drag outside the immediate area and get into a different drop zone element there. And it&#8217;s now easier to position a block on top or on the bottom of the list.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before, it was really hard to get on the bottom of a list when you drag and dropped it. And then the other one is that sometimes in the list view, your container blocks collapsed. And when you dragged a new block into that container, it always put it on the top. Now it makes more sense to put it on the bottom because I added to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when you open up the collapsed block again, you have all the new containers or blocks that you dragged into it on the bottom of the group block, for instance. So I really like those features. They make it much easier to be a little bit more predictable in what you&#8217;re doing and behave like that as you think it would. Intuition is an interesting thing. Sometimes you get it right, but sometimes you get it wrong, and 50/50 is a pretty good ratio for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Yeah, true. And it often takes a few iterations to figure out what the best behavior is and what&#8217;s most intuitive because it&#8217;s not always obvious. When you&#8217;re conceptualizing something, you&#8217;re thinking, &#8220;Oh, let&#8217;s build this new feature. It&#8217;s going to work like this.&#8221; But then in practice, it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh, actually that doesn&#8217;t work very well at all.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So what else is in there? So I stopped at the details block. The experimental flag for the details block was removed and the blocks itself was stabilized. Now you have the two elements: the summary and the details. You can certainly style them accordingly. And now you can also add them to your canvas and it works out of the box. So this is more, it&#8217;s a block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we talked about it before, I think, in last episode as well as the one before. Because it was experimental and we were kind of going back and forth on it. It&#8217;s the block where you can use it as a spoiler alert. You can hide the details of your movie review that would spoil for those who haven&#8217;t seen the movie, spoil the movie ending or that part. Or if it&#8217;s just minutiae detail that only two or three readers would need, you can hide them in the details block, and then you get an error to expand it into the details from the summary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: That&#8217;s pretty cool block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And it was long in the making. It will make it into 6.3. I think there are two other blocks that are on the verge in core, but I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re going to make it. The one is the table of contents block, and the other one is the footnotes block or blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: That&#8217;s sad. Those were really useful blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: It doesn&#8217;t seem&#8230; There wasn&#8217;t any movement on the table of contents block for about a month. So I&#8217;m not sure that anybody takes it on because there are two things that still need to be done there. And the footnotes block, I think Ella is working on that. And she is having two different variations where that needs to be a decision, which one will be pursued or not. And with two weeks to go, it might be a little bit tight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: And it&#8217;s not two weeks, it&#8217;s closer to one week actually because for the packages&#8230; So for all the JavaScript pieces, what happens is we&#8217;re going to grab the release candidate for the next Gutenberg plugin release, which is going to be 16.1. And publish the packages from the release candidates with any bug fixes that are necessary after RC is cut. And those updated packages are what&#8217;s going to make it into core before beta one. And because the RC is going to be created towards….</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Next week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: &#8230; the end of next week. It would usually be on a Wednesday. It is likely at this point that it&#8217;s going to be Thursday or Friday. Given that both editor tech leads for this release are in Australia, we can conceivably do it on our Friday morning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that gives a little bit of extra time. It&#8217;s still Thursday night, everywhere else in the world. So at this point, that is likely to be the plan. And so what&#8217;s going to make it into beta one is anything that can be merged until that date, which is essentially one week away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, it&#8217;s one week away. We are recording this on June 15th, and beta one is the 27th. But the next release candidate, that&#8217;s going to be the 23rd or the 24th. So continuing with 16.0, thank you for this explanation on how tight it actually is with the timeframe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: No worries. We&#8217;re glad to throw everyone into panic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: High alert. So the query pagination block, another feature is that you can hide the label text for the next and previous. You have three choices: you can have an error, you can have carets or you can have text and now you can have both. But you can hide the previous text for it and just have the errors. So that&#8217;s a feature that is on par with the query pagination form classic themes, which is really cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I highlighted one other thing, and it&#8217;s only really relevant for developers that want to get into how to use the HTML tag processor, Jeff Ong refactored the search block to actually use the HTML tag processor. And I think it&#8217;s a good case study on how this actually makes it easier or more readable to use the HTML tag processor instead of rejects in PHP. So I think it&#8217;s the PR51273, if you just want to get up and listen to this, get up and look at it. Of course, it&#8217;s in the Changelog 16.0. Have you worked with the HTML tag processor?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Yeah, I used it a while ago to do some layout-related stuff. So I think I actually was the first person to use that API in Gutenberg. It was still in Gutenberg, hadn&#8217;t been in motion to call yet and it was just being worked on by a few folks. And I was doing a layout-related task where it was trying to add the layout, the class.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So in a block when you have layout support, you get class names that will say what kind of layout it is, and then you can hook styles to them and stuff. And most blocks just have one wrapper. Blocks that have inner blocks have wrapper, inner blocks. But there are some blocks that have a bit more of a complex markup structure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so the idea was that the layout classes should be added to the inner wrapper so that they can have an effect over the inner blocks of the block. And that was a piece where I found using the HTML tag process, it was super handy because I had to locate the inner wrapper of a given block. So that was a great API. It is really, really helpful for that kind of work with PHP when you have to go digging around for some HTML and you don&#8217;t want to use rejects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I think it&#8217;s not tied to WordPress. You actually can use it in any PHP code, so reaching out to the bigger universe outside of WordPress. It&#8217;s definitely an enhancement of the language as well. So another line item from the Changelog is that the post template now has block spacing and layout.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Yeah, I did that one actually.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Congratulations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Well, it went through a few iterations. It was one of those PRs that end up taking a month and have 80 comments on them. Well, maybe not 80 comments, but there was a fair amount of reviews and re-reviews and, &#8220;Should we do it this way? Should we do it that way?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Backwards compatibility was a concern because the blocks in production, there are lots of websites using it, so you can&#8217;t break stuff for real-world users. But it&#8217;s done and pretty happy with it. We talked about it a bit earlier. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s probably necessary to go through what it does again. But I think there&#8217;s a lot of folks who are going to be happy with this one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And I think that answer shows it&#8217;s kind of one answer that I had conversations with people at WordCamp Europe, and it&#8217;s one question I also gathered at WordCamp Asia. And it&#8217;s really hard to answer it because the question is, &#8220;When are design decisions made and who makes them?&#8221; And it&#8217;s very hard to explain that iterative process of developing these new features that haven&#8217;t been in WordPress before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there is an initial design that comes from the design team, but then all subsequent is iteration on how the flow is going to be. And as you said, there are 80 comments there, so that it&#8217;s definitely a community approach to it, or at least a subset of developers trying to figure that out in a team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And testing comes about, and then there&#8217;s going back to the drawing board and then start again. So there is not really that one decision-maker and that one design that is zeroed in on. It&#8217;s more really what the idea was, and then we do the implementation. And then it&#8217;s how it works in context with the other things and it needs to be adopted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: It&#8217;s very much a process. And depending on the complexity for any big piece, you&#8217;ll have a bunch of discussion even before the thing is built. And then, while it&#8217;s being built, there might even be more than one PR, there might be, &#8220;PR one, this approach.&#8221; And then, &#8220;Ah, but there&#8217;s another approach that we could try. Let&#8217;s do another PR and try it.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then people will test and compare the PRs. And we are a very opinionated community, I&#8217;ll tell you that. People will jump on and review and critique and give opinions and go, &#8220;Ah, this is not going to work for this case. And what about this plugin that break things for them?&#8221; And then after all that discussion, something will be agreed. It&#8217;s slowly chipping away and finding a way forward when it&#8217;s, &#8220;Okay, can&#8217;t do this because blah, can&#8217;t do that. I&#8217;ll maybe try that. Okay, that works. That works in testing. Let&#8217;s try it.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the good thing about Gutenberg, about the plugin and this process of working experimentally is that you can merge something into the plugin and try it out, review cycles. And then get feedback from the extremely vocal and passionate community that we have, which I&#8217;m super thankful for. It&#8217;s great to be working on a project and have people just go and, &#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s amazing,&#8221; or &#8220;Oh, sorry, that doesn&#8217;t work for me. We really need to do that instead.&#8221; And you always know where you are. You know, &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;ve done this thing. That worked. Well, maybe that didn&#8217;t work so well, we&#8217;ll need to iterate on it and do something else.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: But sometimes it can be a little tedious, I give you that. But I think the product gets better for it when everybody starts, opens the listening ears and kind of see, &#8220;Okay. Yeah, that&#8217;s certainly valid and I see that use case. And let&#8217;s see if we can include it into the design and into the feature.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Oh, yeah. For sure. And because no one person knows everything, you build a feature, you have your own view of how that feature&#8217;s going to work. And then someone else has a completely different view. And it&#8217;s by getting a lot of different views that we manage to do things that lots of people can use in different ways.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So that answers some of the questions, but maybe not in that way those who ask those questions actually like it. Maybe they just want somebody to blame or something like that. I don&#8217;t know what motivates that kind of question.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: I don&#8217;t know. And sometimes things are subjective. And working on layout-related features, I can tell you that everyone has their opinion on how it should work. And sometimes opinions are clashing because one person thinks it should work this way and another thinks it should work that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nobody&#8217;s right, nobody&#8217;s wrong. We just have to try and figure out which approach is going to satisfy the majority of use cases. It&#8217;s impossible to build a tool that will do every single thing. So it&#8217;s kind of what works best for the most people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Alone the decision to have the toolbar on top or on the block. I don&#8217;t know if the community is 50/50 split, but some people like the toolbar directly on top of the canvas, and some people like it to be close to the block that they are just editing on. But it could also be situational. And these design decisions, it&#8217;s hard. It&#8217;s then kind of, &#8220;Okay. What&#8217;s the design of the feature to change the setting?&#8221; It gets you into to the next conversation with other people about a feature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so it&#8217;s an iterative process and it gets better and better while listening and trying to get it in. So on 6.0, I think we are almost through. We already talked about the Command Center, making the command selectors and actions as well for the public API. And then there is one bug fix that I like to point out, is the fix, the multi-entity, multi-property undo and redo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that is something that really we are waiting for quite a bit that when you highlight something and you delete it and you do undo, you only get one back or two back, but not all of it, for instance. And you cannot redo it because it didn&#8217;t have a memory of what the other properties were. And that has been fixed. And it really happened, and it happened to me, and I think it happened to anybody who experimented with multi-selection at one point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Yeah, for sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So this is fixed and I just wanted to point out, &#8220;Yay.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Yeah, that&#8217;s a great fix. Really needed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Say again?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Really needed, as in a necessary fix.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And I think that was it from the 6.0 release.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What’s in Active Development or Discussed</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So that brings us to the active development or What&#8217;s Discussed section. And I had the idea to actually go to the roadmap of 6.3 and look at things that will make it into 6.3 and two and what&#8217;s not done yet. But there are a lot of links there. And we definitely know that the new blocks&#8217; table of content footnotes are probably not going to make it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is also the introducing UI to safe patterns or all the things around patterns. I&#8217;m a little bit doubtful that we see some of the additional equation flows for patterns in that, what&#8217;s on the roadmap and what already happened but it&#8217;s not part of WordPress 6.3, is the curation filter in the pattern directory. So some core contributors went through the public pattern directory and created a few patterns as well under the WordPress moniker or user account, and then added that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when you go to the pattern directory, you now have not only the categories there, like header or buttons or text or images. You also have a dropdown to select between curated and community. And the curated are the best of the best. Some of the community contributors or WordPress contributors think that those should be highlighted a little bit better or higher or are created by WordPress core contributors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that filter is available now on the pattern directory. It does not yet seem to make it into the pattern inserter that you can do that. But that is definitely on the roadmap, but it&#8217;s not yet done. So I think that the stabilization and usability of the toolbar, the list view and the link control UI, custom list views and library management, those things are almost done going into 6.3. But there is the box shadow component. I think that has already been merged from the design tools. No, that hasn&#8217;t yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Yeah, I think so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: That hasn&#8217;t yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: It hasn&#8217;t? Oh.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Well, the box shadow that you can attach it to all the blocks I think is the one. There are box shadows enabled for certain blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Yeah, got it. I&#8217;m not 100% sure of the status of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And the style block is exposed in the style preview, I think, and details.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Yeah. There seems to still be an active tracking issue here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So it takes a little longer. I think we make this for once we know when beta comes in, what is actually in the release of the features that made it. So in two weeks, when 16.1 stable comes out that&#8217;s passed the beta one release, I think our Changelog, the show will go through the roadmap and check off all the things that come and didn&#8217;t make it into 6.3.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then we have a better conversation than doing it now in just projecting or estimating. And I&#8217;m very bad at predicting. My crystal ball is really in the shop, so I didn&#8217;t know where to go with that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Predictions are always hard. And I think you kind of have to be in-depth knowledgeable about the work that&#8217;s being done. But if you&#8217;re just looking from outside and trying to have a bird&#8217;s eye view here of seeing what&#8217;s going into the release, it&#8217;s impossible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I just have to go and ping people what I&#8217;ve been doing these past few weeks going, &#8220;Oh, hi. What do you think about this feature? Will it make it in? Are you happy to continue working on it? Is it mergeable within the next week or so?&#8221; That kind of thing. And so essentially, it&#8217;s a whole process of just talking to everyone and trying to figure out what stage they are at with the work and what I can help with, that sort of thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And I think an indicator is&#8230; And I will share the link to the project board for editor task on 6.3, so we all can follow up on that and see how that is. Because that&#8217;s updated quite a bit between the editor triage team and the core leads tech teams. So core leads.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Mainly what I&#8217;ve been doing on the board is adding in PRs for back ports to core. I see that there is a bunch of stuff in progress and needs to review columns in this board. I&#8217;m not 100% sure of the status of some of these. Some of these PRs definitely, I think, at this point it&#8217;s unlikely that they&#8217;ll make it in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the fact that it&#8217;s on the board doesn&#8217;t mean&#8230; And even if it&#8217;s marked in progress, it doesn&#8217;t mean that it&#8217;s actually going to make it because it can just be a PR that&#8217;s been sitting there for a while and it&#8217;s on our wishlist. We would love to do it. But if no one&#8217;s actually actively working on it at this point, then it&#8217;s unlikely to make it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And I know that at the editor triage team, we are going through that as well and kind of figure out what comes in as issues from the testing parts of those. So to be sure the features that are in the Gutenberg releases 15.2 to 6.1, if they are not labeled as experimental, will make it into 6.3. So going back to the previous releases of Gutenberg, you can pretty much predict, &#8220;Okay, this is going to be in there.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What will be hard is to find out, &#8220;Well, you will be at 6.1, the release candidate will be next week.&#8221; And that kind of closes the feature freeze pretty much for 6.3, unless there&#8217;s something that is pushed through as a placed task by several core committers to say, &#8220;Yeah, that can make it and that will go in there.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. Well, this was a long show today. Thank you so much for staying with me, Isabel, and providing so much great insights in the development and the design process as well as the release process. Is there anything that you want people to know about 6.3 or Gutenberg project that you are excited about?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: I think we&#8217;ve pretty much covered most of the things about the general processes. I&#8217;m pretty excited about the changes to the site editor and new improvements with browse mode. I hope everyone else is equally excited. I think this is going to be a pretty good release. Thanks for having me. It was a lot of fun chatting about this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So if people want to get in touch with you, how can they find you? What would be a good place?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: I am on GitHub as tellthemachines. I am on WordPress Slack as tellthemachines also. So ping me on Slack. I&#8217;m usually online during the week, Australia time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: All right. Well, thank you so much for being on the show. And I want to point out, we have a Gutenberg Times Live Q&amp;A coming up on July 6th at 17:00 UTC. And that&#8217;s about using Gutenberg scripts and components to revamp a plugin. It&#8217;s a case study and we are talking with the lead developer and the tech lead from GiveWP that have worked on their 3.0 revamp.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And they have used most of the Gutenberg components or based it on WordPress components and scripts. And it opened quite new perspectives for them. So I am really excited to have Jason Adams, the director of development and Jon Waldstein, the lead developer of GiveWP on the show on July 6th, 17:00 UTC. I will share the link in the show notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reserve your spot. And it&#8217;s a usual live Q&amp;A where we have some demos, and then we talk a little bit about the project and then we answer all the attendance questions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As always, the show notes will be published on gutenbergtimes.com/podcast. This is episode 84. And if you have questions, suggestions or news you want us to include, send them to <a href=\"mailto:changelog@gutenbergtimes.com\">changelog@gutenbergtimes.com</a>. That&#8217;s <a href=\"mailto:changelog@gutenbergtimes.com\">changelog@gutenbergtimes.com</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you all for listening. I&#8217;m looking forward to talk to you again in two weeks. Thank you, Isabel Brison. And I am so happy to have another show for you. That&#8217;s it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Yay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Bye-bye.

I also learned about new products, and new APIs. A huge thank you to the sponsors, organizers, speakers, volunteers, contributors, and attendees. It was a fabulous WordCamp, the biggest in the World. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Athens is a great big noisy and beautiful capital of Europe and the birthplace of philosophy and democracy.  I thoroughly enjoyed having a couple of days beyond the WordCamp to visit some sites and experience the antique and the contemporary of Greek art.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of art. My heart made a little jump when I saw the big boxes with Postcards from the <a href=\"https://block-museum.com/\"><strong>Museum of Block Art</strong></a>, at the Community Booth. They were part of the swap exchange game with WordPress trivia. WCEU Attendees received four cards of the same design in their swag bags, and could get the other designs by swapping them with other attendees. To get all eight designs, MCs would pose WordPress Trivia questions from the stage and attendees needed to come with the right answers to the community booth to get an additional post card design. I don&#8217;t know who many people actually appreciated the work of the artists or the work it took to get all the 2500 swag bags filled or how many people actually still write postcards. I found it a wonderful idea and took quite a few left over postcards with me. </p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>What else happened in the Gutenberg space? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yours, 💕<br /><em>Birgit</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-light-background-background-color has-background is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<p><strong>Table of Contents</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-sortabrilliant-guidepost\"><ul><li><a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/feed/#0-word-press-release-information\">Developing Gutenberg and WordPress</a></li><li><a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/feed/#0-p\">Plugins, Themes, and Tools for #nocode site builders and owners</a></li><li><a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/feed/#2-word-press-6-0-1-and-6-1-scheduled\">Theme Development for Full Site Editing and Blocks</a></li><li><a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/feed/#3-building-themes-for-fse-and-word-press\">Building Blocks and Tools for the Block editor. </a></li></ul></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"0-word-press-release-information\">Developing Gutenberg and WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Did y&#8217;all see what the WordPress design team has been working on?

The plugin <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/hyperlink-group-block/\"><strong>Hyperlink Group Block</strong></a> plugin might be the right solution. It allows you to combine blocks into a group wrapped with a hyperlink (&lt;a&gt;). After inserting a Hyperlink Group Block, a Block inserter icon will be displayed to allow you to add new blocks inside that Hyperlink Group Block. You can also transform an existing group block into a hyperlink block.

WordPress 6.2 introduced two new ways to add custom CSS to your site: a global CSS editor, and a per-block CSS editor. Both methods let you add CSS overrides directly in the Site Editor,  to tweak the way your site looks. In this session, Presner covered the differences between the two types of editors, and how to use them effectively and appropriately. As a rare occurrence on WordPress TV, Presner also provided the code snippets and a fabulous list of resources in the comments as well. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nick Diego</strong> hosted <strong><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2023/06/16/summary-lets-chat-about-wordpress-6-3-and-block-theming/\">Hallway Hangout: Let’s chat about WordPress 6.3 and block&nbsp;theming </a></strong>and posted the summary on Make Theme Blog. &#8220;The session began with a brief demonstration of the changes coming to the Site Editor in 6.3, notably page management and new editing flows.

Furthermore, he will be sending some Gutenberg experts to join the sprint without any cost to the Drupal community.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Drupal Gutenberg module is used on more than 3,000 Drupal websites.

They intend to gather people from the WordPress core team who have built the editor, the Drupal core team that knows the needs and possibilities for the admin initiatives, and the Drupal Gutenberg team that built and maintains the module.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Gretland listed several things he hopes the teams can create together, including a Gutenberg starter theme and a starter pack, where Gutenberg is setup with a complete frontend as a base theme or theming reference, as well as the ability to make it work work within the layout builder. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Our goal is to make sure that the Drupal Gutenberg of the future is always using the latest and greatest version from the WordPress team, and better enable Drupal developers to contribute back upstream,&#8221; Gretland said. &#8220;We want Gutenberg more tightly integrated with Drupal and to do this properly we need to gather the people that should be involved. This is a great opportunity to extend our cooperation across open source projects and to move forward making Drupal the most easy to use enterprise CMS.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 16 Jun 2023 19:09:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:46;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:122:\"WPTavern: Finding Freedom and Opportunity With WordPress: How Wolf Bishop Overcame Prison and Addiction to Launch a Career\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=145921\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:132:\"https://wptavern.com/finding-freedom-and-opportunity-with-wordpress-how-wolf-bishop-overcame-prison-and-addiction-to-launch-a-career\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10962:\"<p>In 2005, Timothy &#8220;Wolf&#8221; Bishop was serving time in an Iowa prison for charges related to a gambling addiction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;When I was 25, I made a bet that I could not cover,&#8221; Bishop said. &#8220;I had gambled with a local thug on a local semi-pro baseball game between the Burlington Bees and the Clinton Lumberkings. I bet on the Bees, who lost the game without even scoring. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I did not have the $10,000 I had bet. When I told the man I owed this, he was less than happy. He put a gun to my head and told me that if I did not have his cash in one week, he would put a bullet in my brain. I had the money three days later.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was the crimes Bishop committed to cover that debt that got him sent to prison. Now an experienced professional, entrepreneur, and educator, who has spoken at numerous WordCamps, he credits WordPress for changing the trajectory of his life and helping him find a place of stability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It saved my life,&#8221; Bishop said. &#8220;I am not being over-dramatic when I say that. If it was not for WordPress, I would either still be in prison or dead.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the time Bishop was incarcerated in Rockwell City, the Iowa Department of Corrections began allowing limited internet access to inmates, and he was fortunate enough to be in one of the select prisons. Writing a personal blog was one of the allowed activities, so Bishop went on the hunt for a blogging platform to use. He had already tried many of them, as he had been into open source software since the mid-90&#8217;s. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;As I was also fighting to overcome my gambling addiction, I had the idea of starting a blog about my experience as a sort of self-therapy,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I tried TypePad first, but did not like it. Less than a month later, I discovered WordPress thanks to a correctional officer who had a blog of her own.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Wolf Bishop in prison in 2005, Rockwell City, IA\n\n\n\n<p>The officer had maintained a blog for the past several months and recommended to Bishop that WordPress would be the easiest and best for his needs. This was in the summer of 2005, just a few months after <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2005/02/strayhorn/\">WordPress 1.5</a> was released with a new &#8220;Pages&#8221; feature, a better templating system, and the Kubrick default theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I was at a point in my life when I knew that I needed to change, and drastically, or I was going to be in prison for the rest of my life, or worse….dead,&#8221; Bishop said. &#8220;I know that sounds over dramatic, but I swear it is true. I hoped that by blogging about my battle with addiction, I could better overcome it.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>His first blog launched in September 2005, and he posted weekly for just over one year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Prison is a place where hope is in low supply,&#8221; Bishop said. &#8220;You have to watch your back every minute of every day. Before WordPress, I got in a ton of trouble in prison. I spent a lot of time in the hole. I had nothing to focus my time or energy on, so I fought and walked around with a giant chip on my shoulder.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At one point he realized that he needed to change if he wanted to survive, get out of prison, and stay out of prison, but he was struggling with how to make this happen. Bishop attended Gamblers Anonymous (GA) but described himself as a somewhat shy person and found it difficult to open up to other people in the group.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;You cannot effect change until you open up,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So when I found WordPress I was able to remain somewhat anonymous, and that made it easier to open up. I could write about my struggles and my feelings. I had some place safe to vent my fears and frustrations and anger. I had a safe space to process childhood trauma and self-destructive thought patterns.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In January 2007, Bishop was released from prison and went into a work release program. These kinds of programs have employment requirements and have been shown to lower the recidivism rates among prisons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It was then that I discovered how difficult it is to overcome the stigma of being a felon,&#8221; he said. &#8220;No matter how much I wanted to do better and succeed, it proved to be more challenging than I expected. Within three months I was sent back to prison for a parole violation after losing my minimum wage job.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bishop, who describes himself as &#8220;a pretty intense mix,&#8221; of being bi-polar and living with ADHD on the Autism spectrum, found it difficult in prison to manage the mental and emotional health issues that led him to a gambling addiction. Mental health resources for prisoners can be scarce, but blogging helped him find a way through.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I guess you could just call it personal talk therapy,&#8221; he said. &#8220;By writing about the experiences I had, being in prison, and how I was feeling, I was able to address my demons and work through the thought patterns that kept leading to destructive behaviors. I guess you could say it was more like a publicly accessible journal.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Launching a WordPress Career Fresh Out of Prison</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>What Bishop learned in the work release program in 2007 about the challenges inmates face after prison became even more clear when he was finally released in 2010. Even though he had fully completed his sentence and was not on supervision, the challenges remained.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Every GOOD job I applied for shot me down the second they learned I was an ex-con,&#8221; Bishop said. &#8220;From 2010 until 2015, I struggled to get a job that would pay the bills. I worked dead end fast food and temp jobs.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2015, he and his wife were homeless with three small children living in a tent in Texas. It was this year that he was given the opportunity that launched his career in WordPress. He was offered a support role at InMotion Hosting. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;They took a chance on me and they paid for us to move to Virginia Beach,&#8221; Bishop said. &#8220;At first, we still lived in a tent and then a hotel. From there it was an upward trajectory and my career has continued to grow.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<img />Wolf Bishop speaking at WordCamp Atlanta in 2018\n\n\n\n<p>In the years following, Bishop has worked in various support roles and branched out into launching his own development and hosting companies. He is now on his fourth WordPress business, <a href=\"https://wpoctane.co/\">WP Octane</a>, which follows two that failed and two that he successfully built and sold. WP Octane started in 2016 under the name WP Top Hat, and was geared towards being a 1-stop WordPress shop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The idea was to have a company that provided everything a business needed for its online presence,&#8221; Bishop said. &#8220;But trying to provide managed hosting, ongoing care, content management, marketing, SEO, and several other services proved to be more than I could handle on my on.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2019, just before the pandemic hit, he decided to convert to just a managed WordPress host with ongoing care plans included, and changed the name to WP Octane. For the next two years his small startup struggled to thrive during the pandemic, although he did see some growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Finally, in early 2022, WP Octane became profitable for the very first time,&#8221; Bishop said. &#8220;Since then we have continued to grow, albeit slowly.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In late 2022, after investing more into infrastructure, WP Octane pivoted again to offer low cost shared WordPress hosting that serves a middle of the road between shared and managed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We limit tenancy of all servers to a fraction of what most shared hosts have,&#8221; Bishop said. &#8220;We introduced features that allow us to outperform most shared hosts and come pretty close to matching performance of a managed WordPress host. We have virtually eliminated many of the typical pitfalls of shared hosting like the dreaded noisy neighbor syndrome.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>WP Octane still offers fully managed plans with ongoing care included as they did previously, but the new shared platform has taken off better than Bishop expected and is now the company&#8217;s primary focus.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Empowering Inmates and Ex-Convicts for Success with WordPress Skills</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Bishop is also now invested in giving back through a new effort to launch a prison program that will teach inmates the skills they need to use WordPress. The program is still in its early stages and has gotten preliminary approval from the Missouri Department of Corrections, which is local to where he now lives on 63 acres in the Ozarks. He is working on completing the curriculum, a requirement before it can be fully approved. The target for that phase is early August so it can go to a committee for approval at a September meeting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It is this struggle that led me to start this project,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I want to give inmates that truly want to turn their lives around a skill that can enable them to do just that. If they learn how to work with WordPress, whether it be design, development, SEO, or any other area, they can avoid some of the challenges I faced.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bishop said inmates equipped with WordPress skills will not be at the mercy of employers who are unwilling to give them a chance, because they have a skill they can use independently. If they go the route of custom development, most clients do not ask for a background check.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;When participants complete the program and eventually get out of prison, they will have a portfolio that they can show to potential clients and even employers,&#8221; Bishop said. &#8220;It is my hope that it will increase their chances of success.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a first of its kind program that is still awaiting final approval. In the beginning he is aiming to launch it in the Missouri prison system but said he would love to take it nationwide some day. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bishop is also working on a related project &#8211; a website that lists employment opportunities with WordPress companies that are willing to give ex-offenders a chance. The project is still in the early planning stages as he talks with employers to encourage them to join this movement. His experience with this community has led him to believe that WordPress will be a beacon of hope and opportunity for anyone who wants to make something on the web.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;WordPress helped me overcome addiction,&#8221; Bishop said. &#8220;It taught me the value of community and that if you are willing to put in the work, you do not have to rely on others to &#8216;let&#8217; you succeed. WordPress lets you make success a choice.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 16 Jun 2023 15:58:03 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:47;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:134:\"Post Status: Sustainability Team • Supporting Organizations • Commercial &amp; Community Themes &amp; Plugins • Pattern Curation\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=149632\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:121:\"https://poststatus.com/sustainability-team-supporting-organizations-commercial-community-themes-plugins-pattern-curation/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:17743:\"<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-this-week-at-wordpress-org-april-3-2023\">This Week at WordPress.org (June 12, 2023)</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"has-background has-theme-palette-8-background-color wp-block-post-excerpt\"><p class=\"wp-block-post-excerpt__excerpt\">The WordPress Sustainability Team has launched.

In this episode, they discuss designing pricing plans and creating a compelling website homepage for their new product. They delve into the intricacies of annual and lifetime subscription options and the inclusion of site licenses for different customer segments. They also explore the balance between providing value and maintaining profitability. Throughout the conversation, they brainstorm ideas, share case studies, and weigh the pros and cons of various pricing strategies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Top Takeaways:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Consider customer preferences</strong>. It is critical to understand customer preferences and needs when determining pricing plans. Exploring options, such as lifetime licenses and differentiating plans based on the number of sites, can help you strike a balance between value and affordability for customers.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Seek feedback</strong>. Recognize the value of seeking feedback from others in relevant communities. Reach out for input and opinions. External perspectives can provide valuable insights and help refine your approach.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Focus on website messaging and design</strong>. Acknowledge the importance of presenting information in a coherent and engaging manner. Consider using design elements to enhance a website&#8217;s overall visual appeal and user experience.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading eplus-wrapper\" id=\"h-mentioned-in-the-show\"><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f517.png\" alt=\"🔗\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> Mentioned in the show:</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://crop.express/\">Crop.Express</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://easydigitaldownloads.com/\">Easy Digital Downloads</a> </li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://ithemes.com/backupbuddy/?=matchtype=b&keyword=backup%20buddy%20plugin&cid=14487028719&agid=132326792291&device=c&placement=&creative=629501906087&target=&adposition=&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_term=backup%20buddy%20plugin&utm_content=629501906087&utm_campaign=search+-+na+-+backup+-+buddy&gad=1&gclid=CjwKCAjw-IWkBhBTEiwA2exyOyk30qMKQEhBpuZK9jf3naRBMo4QTSmwsJyLWPePozHgvkpdOO3tOBoCOroQAvD_BwE\">BackupBuddy</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading eplus-wrapper\" id=\"h-you-can-follow-post-status-and-our-guests-on-twitter\"><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f426.png\" alt=\"🐦\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> You can follow Post Status and our guests on Twitter:</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"eplus-wrapper\">\n<li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/coreymaass\">Corey Maass</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/corymiller303\">Cory Miller</a> (CEO, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/post_status\">Post Status</a>)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/lemonadecode\">Olivia Bisset</a> (Intern, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/post_status\">Post Status</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"eplus-wrapper has-background\">The <strong>Post Status Draft</strong> podcast is geared toward WordPress professionals, with interviews, news, and deep analysis. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f4dd.png\" alt=\"📝\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /><br /><br /><a href=\"https://poststatus.com/category/post-status-podcasts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Browse our archives</a>, and don’t forget to subscribe via <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/post-status-draft-wordpress/id976403008\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">iTunes</a>, <a href=\"https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5zaW1wbGVjYXN0LmNvbS8ySkU5c2M4UA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Google Podcasts</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/PostStatus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">YouTube</a>, <a href=\"http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/krogsgard/post-status-draft-wordpress-podcast\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Stitcher</a>, <a href=\"https://wordpress-post-status-draft-podcast.simplecast.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Simplecast</a>, or <a href=\"https://feeds.simplecast.com/2JE9sc8P\">RSS</a>. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f3a7.png\" alt=\"🎧\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading eplus-wrapper\" id=\"h-transcript\">Transcript</h2>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Session 17 Corey &amp; Cory Launch a WordPress Product Live</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>C&amp;C 17</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:00] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Webinar. Webinar is live. We&#8217;re live session Summit. Corey and Corey launching a product. Okay.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:11] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> So we all go up together. Yeah. You&#8217;re probably already standing, aren&#8217;t you? I am. Although you&#8217;re leaning.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:19] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> I&#8217;m leaning, standing, standing. Okay. Yep. We were, uh, just talking through a logo. We&#8217;ve had some revisions with the designer, and so Corey was sharing some of the thoughts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think this is part of that journey is like, something&#8217;s always in the way, you know, that you gotta Yeah,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:38] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> exactly. Like, so yeah, I, you know, so the plugin is coming along really well. Um, but to do, uh, you know, to, to feel like you&#8217;re really moving forward, Uh, for branding and marketing, which we&#8217;ve talked about a bit in the last couple of weeks, we, we need the logo, which defines the colors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the good news is we can, we can take the colors that we&#8217;ve got from the logo, um, and you know, and we can, and we can start moving forward with some things. But it&#8217;s, um, we approved the horizontal. So if you&#8217;re looking at my screen, um, I, what I think they&#8217;ve done. Which is fine. Uh, um. Is they took the, originally, I thought it was a white bar over, um, I think it&#8217;s Montserrat is the final font, which is great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and I think what they&#8217;ve actually done is, is split it in half, which is fine because that that leaves No, my, my previous issue was there were like little triangles. Based on where they cut it. Um, and so the, the horizontal looks good now, but when you go over to the vertical, what they should have done is, is take the revision of the I M G from the [00:02:00] horizontal and applied it to the vertical.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think they took us at our word that they, that we were like, you know, and the vertical&#8217;s. Okay. So they were just like, here it is, even though it&#8217;s inconsistent. So, One more revision. Um, and uh, and I, I mean, what&#8217;s great is, is they are giving us the e p s. You can see I&#8217;ve got Illustrator open in the background.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, so I can mess around with it cuz I&#8217;m still not totally sold on. The, the vertical version, which is not their fault. Like they&#8217;ve done what we&#8217;ve said. Um, I, so I think we wanna go back to them and say, Hey, you know, please update the vertical, the i m g on the vertical based on the changes that you made to the I M G in the horizontal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:54] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> really what you mean there is, is not just colors, but is it the bar where the bar is?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:58] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Yeah. Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah. The colors of the vertical are fine. Because we, we sort of defined that based on the website we sent them. Um, but you know, I guess it would be, yeah, it would be nice since it would be nice if they finished what they were doing kind of thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and then I think at some point you and I like, I think we go forward with this and this is part of us talking about, uh, you know, and, whoops, did I lose my microphone? There we go. Um, You know, part of the journey is, um, just pun just, just moving forward, you know? And so it&#8217;s like, I don&#8217;t. If they fix the bar, I&#8217;m content with putting this online.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not totally sold that, that this is actually the best vertical version, but at some point, you know, it, it&#8217;ll occur to us like, oh, the black should be the bottom third of each, or whatever. And. And I&#8217;ll go into, you know, either, we&#8217;ll, we&#8217;ll use them again and say, okay, we need another revision, or I&#8217;ll go in and make the change, but good enough for now or go once they make the change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s at least consistent then good enough. And I was half joking that the, the real reason I&#8217;m in such a hurry is that, um, sticker Mule runs specials every week and so their coupons run out and inevitably that&#8217;s, um, so how, that&#8217;s how we end up with like 10 of the crop express coupon, the stickers that we don&#8217;t actually need.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:42] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Nostalgia. Um, hey, so. Here, here&#8217;s my question. What, what are the things that you want changed here? Like, one thing that stick out, obviously the bar you want it moved up toward the top. Omg.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:58] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> No, I, all I want is, um, for them, I think I&#8217;ve even got it open, so I just want them to take the, the img. Oh. From here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. And, and put it where it&#8217;s supposed to, you know, replace what, what they had. So really, there&#8217;s&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:19] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> two bars on the vertical version?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:22] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Uh, I think there&#8217;s, I mean, so it&#8217;s like, oh, okay. Yeah. See how there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s that little carrot taken out right. Of, of the m. But on here, we had asked them to remove it, so there is none.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay. So it&#8217;s like if they just update the i, the m and the G of the vertical version using the, the revised i m g of the horizontal, we&#8217;re, we&#8217;re done. Okay.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:59] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> So it, it occurs to me though, when you&#8217;re looking at this, the, the OMG fills letter spacing this wider mm-hmm. In the vertical than it is the horizontal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s maybe one of the things I was thinking of, like, can you copy and paste the horizontal into a new, so we can look at it real quick or just pull that IMG down or something so we can look at it. Yep. You see that letter space in here looks way tighter,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:24] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> which it will be because they&#8217;re putting the I under the O.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the O is so much wider.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:32] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> It still looks, but look at this space between the O and the M. It just feels loose. Mm-hmm. Yep. Here, I&#8217;ll show you. I&#8217;ll try it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:45] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Yeah. Um,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:49] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> like it, can you take the IMG right there and put and pull it underneath just to see how Yep, yep,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:55] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> yep.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Showing off my. Amazing skills here, but yeah, if we matched Okay. The M and the G Well,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:15] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> hey, go up. Yeah, yeah, right there. Hold on just a second. Let&#8217;s look at that for a second.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t know the, the vertical version that they&#8217;ve got just feels. And&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:29] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> get it. Oh, I see. Yeah. The white space is so much more between all of the letters. Yeah. It&#8217;s just, just which I, which I suspect they did because they&#8217;re trying to match. It&#8217;s like if, if these are here, then, then it&#8217;s more pronounced.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Between the I and the M, like there&#8217;s no good answer for that right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That looks&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:01] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> better though to me. Yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:05] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> So yeah, have &#8217;em have &#8217;em do a version where they&#8217;re like, literally put the i m G below the the OMG and center the eye and call it done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:18] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Can you move the eye over just so we can see? Yeah. See how it looks. For a second.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:25] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Maybe I just did it. Huh?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t hate it. Right. It&#8217;s, yeah. It might be, it might be enough to go live with, and again, at some point it, it&#8217;ll occur to us what&#8217;s wrong with it or how to fix it. Yeah. Or, you know, we will have totally changed our branding by then or something. Okay.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:52] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Hold on a second. Let me screenshot that. Okay. I mean, do you like the two bars on the vertical?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:02] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> I&#8217;m conflicted because when you get small it becomes unreadable. Right? And that&#8217;s honestly how most, most people are gonna see it. Most of the time. Like in, in the plug-in repo, you know, it, you can, you do okay. Where it&#8217;s there, but it&#8217;s like not contrasty enough. But like in most places it&#8217;s gonna end up small, small, and it just, you can&#8217;t read it at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m kind of, of the mind, like I said now of. Good enough, like this lets us go live and we can, we can change it. Okay. You know?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sounds good. Um, so cool. That&#8217;s that. So honestly, like I will just, I will stop mucking about with the one they sent. Um, and why don&#8217;t we just use this for now? Yeah. And essentially live with it, you know, but in, in the wild for a while and see how we feel about it. Okay. Um, cool. So that&#8217;s the logo. And then, um, a while ago on AppSumo, I signed up for a lifetime deal of ui, which lets you run te essentially like repeat, click, click, click.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, um, I&#8217;ve been setting up testing cuz I&#8217;m sort of in the weeds with where I think everything&#8217;s working. But this way it at least clicks through and, um, makes sure that we have all the basic features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, um, Once that&#8217;s done, like I think we&#8217;re, I think the plugin version one is, is ready to go. Um, and so honestly, unless you have something else, what I was thinking was we might, like, while we&#8217;re sitting here for the next hour, 45 minutes, we&#8217;ve got, um, let&#8217;s take the wording that we came up with last week and just do a quick bang through of the homepage and plug it in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nothing like building, building a website live. Is this you ui&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:51] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> or something different?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:53] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Uh, so this is our current homepage, omg img.co. Okay. And, uh, on the left and then on the right. Is the words we came up with last time. Okay, cool. So, uh, in builder. So let&#8217;s see. What&#8217;s cool is we do now have, um, did I close it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How I minimize it, file.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We do now have colors</p>\n\n\n\n<p>again. I do not know Illustrator very well. One of the things that I always like to do on all of my websites is create a page called Assets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And here we say Diviv. Oops. Style.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How was breakfast, by the way? Good. Good to see&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:16] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> my grandfather, he&#8217;s 93 years old. Wow. Yeah. Good for him. He&#8217;s the OG entrepreneur.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He sold his business about three, four months after I sold mine, but he had his longer. I told him, I said I might&#8217;ve beat him to that, but he beat me in longevity. He had a motorcycle dealership for 40&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:42] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> years. Wow. What kind of motorcycles? Honda in Yamaha.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:48] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Nice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can&#8217;t remember if we talked about this. You&#8217;ve rid, you had a motorcycle that you showed me.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:58] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Four-wheeler. Uh, I&#8217;m trying to have a motorcycle. Um, I, yeah, I owned it for about an hour and then, uh, it stopped running, which I knew was always going to be an issue cuz it&#8217;s, uh, 1982 something. But I hoped I could work on it, but in the end I couldn&#8217;t.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and the. The shop that it went to has now had it for a year, and I keep stopping by and I&#8217;m like bringing them donuts and stuff cuz I&#8217;m like, how do we move this forward? But so far, no, no joy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you&#8217;re&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:45] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> using Uber Builder and doing an assets page. That&#8217;s cool.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:50] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Yeah, so this is what I do for, um, all of my sites, um, is like once I&#8217;ve got a color palette, um, usually I&#8217;m using, uh, colors, col, col coolers or whatever. Um, Look at that rainbow. That&#8217;s fantastic. I love those colors.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:14] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> So you create this within Beaver Builder to kind of reference within the website?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:19] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Yeah. Like, uh, I&#8217;ll come in and I&#8217;ll drop in the logos. So it&#8217;s like, cuz inevitably, you know, you&#8217;re, you&#8217;re making changes live somewhere or. You know, you&#8217;re updating your Twitter account profile or your, you know, somebody&#8217;s like, oh, I, hey, could you send me a logo? You know, I&#8217;m interviewing you on a podcast and you send me a logo and you&#8217;re like, let me go look through a thousand folders to try to find that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or you can just say, go to slash assets. Um, just kind of a, a habit I got into a while ago. Um, And then it also helps with like defining, you know, doing this kind of thing where it&#8217;s like, once you define, have your colors defined once you can save them, stuff like that. So anyway, um, so we&#8217;ll plug into logo later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, so words on the right, what&#8217;s, what&#8217;s the first one we want to go with? Like what I figure is this on the left will be a product shot. Sure.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:27] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Let me find, uh, that doc you&#8217;re looking at. Website. Got it. Okay. Okay, cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What about professional? Social images for your website in content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:10] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> For your WordPress website. I always like to put in WordPress right up front so that people aren&#8217;t like, sure, I&#8217;m on Wick. Why can&#8217;t I use this? Yeah,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>it&#8217;s not. They have Montserrat. Whoops. Yep, I do. There it&#8217;s so wheat,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>extra bowl, ultra bowl.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:41] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Boom.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:52] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Bigger. I want bigger,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>and we can mess with this kind of stuff later, but if we get it to find so professional social images for your WordPress website and content. Okay. What if that&#8217;s&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:14] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> what, if that&#8217;s the subhead and because see, we got in here because your image matters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What if we make that the headline and then professional social, you know, create mm-hmm. Professional social images for your workforce website and content so that, like the headline is because your l your image matters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:47] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> So like swap the use basically? Yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:49] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Yeah. Because your image matters. I like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:02] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> I want the, cuz you&#8217;re, Because your images matter feels like better English. But&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:13] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> overall, you know, I think it&#8217;s cuz your image mattered. Like, and that&#8217;s all of these things helps you with your, like, it&#8217;s more abstract than social images, you know,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:25] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> because your Oh, nice. Got it. Yeah. And the pun about. How people perceive you, your image and Oh, brilliant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Love it. Totally missed that. Um,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:39] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> and then for this, how about, it&#8217;s like an action ver that says transformer create professional social images for your WordPress website and content. Love it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:05] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> And then of course a big button, not a button group. Not a button, which is right there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Buy it today. Purchase it. I never know what to do in these buttons.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:24] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Yeah,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>buy, shoot. What&#8217;s the normal thing? Get started by, uh, pricing. Um, yeah, buy today works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, could you put image on the second line?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay. Cool. Okay, so we got top, top header. I think that that, that&#8217;s a good start. Yep. Okay. Then we talked about, uh, benefits or on our web doc here we have the before and after.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:27] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Mm-hmm. So if we did, yeah. So, uh, what, to me, what&#8217;s funny here would be. An image is worth a thousand words. The obvious. Yeah. Worth a thousand words.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then here we have</p>\n\n\n\n<p>like, obviously I have to create these, but a before and after. Yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:01] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Um, oh, I like that. So I like that because the image could have the before and the after, and then underneath we could have, you know, this list we talked about, like boring afterthought, stale homo placeholder, and then after a sparkle and ties hook, engaged in, compelling, something like that if we wanted to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mm-hmm. I kinda though it&#8217;s like right, right at top, almost before above the fold. We have a really good explanation&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:28] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> of.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, so if like, we don&#8217;t need to repeat repo before and after, but, so I really like the idea of, um, so basically we, we use our own words to say,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first one to make it clear what&#8217;s going on here before and after. But then you&#8217;d say boring.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:07] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Um, oh yeah, boring still. Afterthoughts, homogenized, placeholder,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:17] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> right? And so it&#8217;s like,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So something like that. So it&#8217;s like before, before, after. Okay. Here&#8217;s an, here&#8217;s a simple example. Here&#8217;s an, here&#8217;s another example of, you know, the landscape and then the enticing. So it&#8217;s like, you know, we&#8217;re repeating without having to repeat. Before, after, before, after, before, after. Over and over again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s cool. That&#8217;s a good idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Snail boring and I really like placeholder. And we could do something like, you know, from placeholder. Yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:01] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> From, oh, I like that. From boring to enticing, from placeholder to engaging or whatever that is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:23] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Yeah,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know my text is wrong, but</p>\n\n\n\n<p>oops.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, what&#8217;s the right arrow</p>\n\n\n\n<p>or after from boring to engaging from placeholder. Oh, we already did. Engaging,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>oh, bo from boring to enticing from placeholder to engaging something like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Please hold her. So there, there, I feel like we&#8217;ll want a, a noun. Yeah. I&#8217;m boring to engaging. I like better. And then from placeholder to quite well presentable, placeholder to powerful, placeholder to hummus. I don&#8217;t know. Um,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:48] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> I like that. We&#8217;ll wanna nail the photos, but that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s the product. Um, yeah, I think that&#8217;s great, man.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay. We&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:55] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> can do, hold on. Lemme get the right green.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Row settings</p>\n\n\n\n<p>safe. Okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then</p>\n\n\n\n<p>benefits. Benefits. Um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No more boring afterthought, stale&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:32] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> images. I wonder if we say stale. No more stale images since we use Born and Afterthought Above. Mm-hmm. Um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>entice people to click. See. How many sections&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:52] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> do we have? Three. Okay. Well, uh, you know, we can have as many as we want. It was just, okay,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:01] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> so I think, let&#8217;s see. No more still images entice. Do we use entice about entice people to click more value in your images? Uh, I think if we did three, it&#8217;d be no more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stella Images entice people to click Stay in your WordPress workflow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:35] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Nice people to click with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Valuable content right inside your image or something like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then what was the last one? Stay&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:53] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> in your WP Workflow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:11] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> No more jumping from app to app. Yep. To make your images&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:23] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> shine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay. And then, so did you just load a standard Beaver builder page, or do you, is this a template you use for stuff?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:42] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> I just, we, there was one of the websites we were looking at that was just like, there are these rows, and so I just banged out some rows. Awesome. So this is, you know, I have, I have no religion about this page whatsoever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can, yeah. I was just kidding. Massage this any number of ways.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:02] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> So I think that section is benefits. Then we get down to brass tacks of like features. Okay.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:12] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> So, yeah, let&#8217;s for the sake of, I never want to actually like, say benefits, but for the sake of our knocking this out, this is benefits, this is features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:43] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> I always like seeing how other people do this stuff cuz.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:48] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Well, exactly. That was part of why I figured we&#8217;d do it live. Cuz it&#8217;s like, cool, let&#8217;s, you know, somebody else can, who has never seen Beaver Builder can check it out and or you know, has never knocked together. So I, and I love what we did. Like normally I&#8217;d be sitting here staring at text boxes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Whereas you and I did the words in a Word doc, which is so much smarter, but I&#8217;m usually too impatient to do that. Yeah. So, um, So I have a feeling that we can,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>actually, why don&#8217;t I just do this,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>rose</p>\n\n\n\n<p>benefits, we&#8217;ll say duplicate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Almost one click.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Post product</p>\n\n\n\n<p>or podcast info, right? Add info, right. Into your</p>\n\n\n\n<p>featured image, um, keyword stuffing, and I don&#8217;t know that it actually reads as English, but</p>\n\n\n\n<p>featured image, so people want to click more something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, beautiful, versatile templates, shoes from.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whoops. I got it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Customization,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>um, your. And colors</p>\n\n\n\n<p>and fonts or&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:10] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> consistent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:17] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Keep going. Keep going. We got two more.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:21] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Let&#8217;s see. Um, each pose, beautiful templates, customization.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, you can download images. Hmm. Uh, create images by social channel&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:44] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> customization, um, or channel, uh,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:57] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Middle size,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:00] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> uh oh. Right. Um, create once, use everywhere. Um, create an image and then resize it for, um, open graph.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn. What&#8217;s the only fans? Um, what&#8217;s the, the ultra white. Ultra Ultra White. Ultra right? Conservative. We should, we&#8217;ll, we&#8217;ll just keyword stuff. All of these, you know. Um, Open graph, Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter. Any other channel you yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:59] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Need capitalize that T real quick.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yep. Thank you. Yep. Thank you. Thank you. Hey, this might be a nuance, but is op open graph not two words?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:09] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> That is a great question. Facebook open. Yeah. Open graph. Two words.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:21] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Okay. So we need to change that up at the top too. Yeah. Or somewhere we did it somewhere else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe that was it. I thought there was something above. But</p>\n\n\n\n<p>you gonna write a note on our thing? Like we needed a, what is open graph? Hmm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>you know, all the social software do these, what sizes are what, but it&#8217;s still good content that people want to reference even though we&#8217;ve got it baked in. Yeah. So, Some sort images by</p>\n\n\n\n<p>at the bottom of this document.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we got six. Mm-hmm. I think that&#8217;s a good start. I&#8217;m trying to think if we&#8217;ve missed anything. I mean, you can save &#8217;em as projects. That&#8217;s one. I mean, really it&#8217;s a social image generator regardless of the content I. Create images in there. So it&#8217;s a social image generator. But, um, just talking out. Thanks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make sure I didn&#8217;t miss anything. We already have size. Do we have sizing somewhere? No, no. I dot Maybe that&#8217;s not a customization. Customizing and resize. No, I don&#8217;t know. See,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:28] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> right. The resizing we&#8217;ve got. Create once. Use everywhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So open graph images for your site, open graph images for each post page, et cetera. Oh, each post</p>\n\n\n\n<p>or page. Beautiful, versatile templates. Use our bespoke templates to match your branding or upload your own customization. Um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>tweak.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oops.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:40:36] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Make sure and save. What&#8217;s that? Make sure and save. Yeah. Is it auto save or do you need to save&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:40:45] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> it every now and then? Um, I think it sort of does, but we can publish as we go cuz it can&#8217;t be any worse than the placeholder We already have Command&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:40:52] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> s Man, that&#8217;s my, uh, mantra.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:40:57] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Command s Yeah. Yeah. I really, that&#8217;s sorry about the dog.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, yeah, I like, I&#8217;ve gotten used to like the, Um, code editor. I used Auto Saves and like here in ui, like it just saves as you go, which I&#8217;m always grateful&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:41:15] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> for. It&#8217;s funny, the old days, you know, you had to command s everything and I still want to do it even box. Yep. So next session section is plans.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:41:29] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> So yeah, we, we will want testimonials, but we don&#8217;t have any yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:41:39] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> mean, in Lugo testimonials, we can say, see it in action, you know? Hmm. With the post status stuff,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:41:50] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> we call that a, um, what do they call it? A case study. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A studies. So how do we want to present this, I guess is the. The question, the case study? Yeah, I, I guess just like a picture. I don&#8217;t know,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:42:40] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> I think we pushed this maybe down below, um, plans for now, but that&#8217;s just a first reaction. Um, yeah, I see it in action.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:42:58] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> It&#8217;s okay. So yeah, if here we had,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>so down here we said see it in action, see it in action. And then here we have plans. So plans on the homepage? I think so. Okay. Um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>so we&#8217;re not doing free, right? Um, so currently I think we&#8217;re talking about annual Yeah. And lifetime.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:43:58] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> think a lifetime with the cab, you know, the caveats we discussed, which is sport for one year. But, uh, you know, lifetime upgrades I think is a good starter thing that we know will probably go away. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Um, so we could have an, we could have annual B two thing, well,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>one site. Lots of, oh. Um,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:44:31] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> do we want to do it that way? Yeah. E D D C E. Um, easy digital download supports. So annual and lifetime, and then also number of sites. And I tend to be a big baby about it because, uh, I always just am happier as a customer when it&#8217;s unlimited sites. But I think we can, there&#8217;s.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:45:07] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> No, I get you there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What if we did, um, like the solo, you know, they just have one site. Mm-hmm. And then we did the kind of freelancer agency bundle, and that&#8217;s how we kind of differentiated. So like one site is like, I just want the one. Yep. Uh, and then, um, for that avatar, and then for the agencies, we just say like, it&#8217;s the bundle, the.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Annual unlimited or the lifetime thing? That could be okay. That could be our three plans. I&#8217;m just talking this out with you&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:45:45] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> though. Yeah, yeah, for sure. Um, so we&#8217;re talking about solo one site. Yeah. Basically&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:45:56] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> the</p>\n\n\n\n<p>main, you know, It&#8217;s funny. So let me give you a quick case study. So backup buddy for instance, it they form that form, that product formulated all their pricing plans and mm-hmm. Uh, definitely you see that within the industry, but it was our first big one back in 2010. And so, but our thesis was meant for a backup plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You need a two side plugin. What if your side goes down? You need another one. So we started, we, we sold two side plans. Now, That, that sounds very like reasonable, right? People would say, every now and then, do you just have a one side version? You&#8217;re like, are you</p>\n\n\n\n<p>it? It&#8217;s almost like this. It&#8217;s this funny thing within product stuff. It&#8217;s like, why am I paying for more than I need? And you&#8217;re like, okay. So I tend to think there&#8217;s some terminology we put around here. It&#8217;s just like you have a website, a blog, whatever that is. Maybe it&#8217;s the content creator package, um, and web, we just need one, but that needs to be probably higher because why wouldn&#8217;t you just go ahead and get, um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>and then I think the,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>hold on just a second. And then, yeah, agency plan and lifetime Limited, limited&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:47:32] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> lifetime. So how many sites? So it&#8217;s like, yeah. Okay. Yeah, if you want. So it&#8217;s um, we&#8217;re just mocking this up here. Do, do text editor. So it&#8217;s like website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One site license. Yep.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Agency</p>\n\n\n\n<p>what? 10, 20. I mean, this is an arbitrary number. Yeah. Let&#8217;s start with 10. So 10 site licenses. Yep. Annual subscription. Yep.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then</p>\n\n\n\n<p>way get out of the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then limited lifetime. This is</p>\n\n\n\n<p>100. Site licenses. Yeah, there you go.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:48:55] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> There you go. Because it&#8217;s not really unlimited for everything. [00:49:00] Yeah. Let&#8217;s see. That, uh, we use on purchase up time. Updates only support one year. Support&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:49:09] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> one year.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:49:10] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> So many people paying this, but I go, no, it&#8217;s not unlimited Everything. Right. Support is what it costs us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re gonna be doing updates for this for foreseeable future. So like that&#8217;s already built in. But support is extra now. People still don&#8217;t read, don&#8217;t think about it. They put it off, don&#8217;t. But I, I think, you know, we, we do a one to three month type thing. Seat, our initial customer list. Mm-hmm. Use them for feedback, bugs, stuff like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>New ideas. And then we just take that down. That&#8217;ll give us some&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:49:44] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> cash too. Oh, whoops. I&#8217;m doing these backwards. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So one site license.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yep. Annual subscription agency, 10 site licenses, annual subscription, limited lifetime, and hundred site licenses. One time purchase updates forever. And this is, this is where most agencies will probably jump anyway, right? Cuz it&#8217;s like, just buy it, you know, if it&#8217;s, uh, I think we&#8217;d talked about like 50 bucks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, 300 bucks, 500 bucks, whatever it is. Yeah. They&#8217;ll just go, you know what, it&#8217;s 500 bucks and we never have to think about it again. Of course we&#8217;re gonna do it. Yeah. Hey&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:50:39] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Corey, I&#8217;m sorry for being late today. I need to spin down about five minutes, but here&#8217;s my, here&#8217;s my thought on this. Let&#8217;s think, let&#8217;s anchor ourselves for a moment in lifetime and, uh, the lifetime price and let&#8217;s go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay. It&#8217;s unlimited. We&#8217;re gonna for the goal of one, to get cash and also to seed our customer base for features, all that kind of stuff. Um, and then I think we go down, down this box to the left. Mm-hmm. And like, really, I think for this initial thing, we want people in lifetime cause we wanna see that group.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, maybe it&#8217;s the first a hundred people and then kind of close off, but. I think that could help us price the agency and website stuff because honestly, we&#8217;ll want that higher to push &#8217;em up to lifetime, um, for the beginning in, in my mind. Um, so how does, how does that sound like as far as what, what, what, if we go with that for a second, what price will we want to do that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlimited or lifetime unlimited bundle. So the&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:51:49] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> rule of thumb that I go by for lifetime is three years. And, uh, and then here we&#8217;re introducing number of sites. So it&#8217;s how much, how much value per site times three years. And like we are, we&#8217;re saying, you know, a hundred sites, but realistically, you know, it&#8217;s.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kind of like you say, three years. Most people subscribe between two and 300 site licenses. May as well be unlimited, unless you are some bananas agency or you&#8217;re cranking out, um, just click bait websites. But so it&#8217;s like 20 sites times three years. Yeah, something like that. And so if it&#8217;s. Because it&#8217;s a big fat discount.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you were at $30 times, 20 sites times three years, you&#8217;re talking about 1800 bucks, which I just can&#8217;t, like that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s the value. But for a new product, I think people are gonna be like, the hell are you thinking?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I, I guess I, I hear your, uh, your thought process to me. 1, 1 1 website currently, because it&#8217;s a new product, $50 feels about right. And so then it&#8217;s, so let if, if one website, if this is $50, then agency is $40 per site times 10 sites, and then Lifetime knocks it down to $30 per site. But obviously we can&#8217;t multiply it by 99 or by a hundred.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But do you know what I mean? Like Yeah. To me that&#8217;s the discount. You&#8217;d kind of, you know, buy in bulk discount. The way we&#8217;re thinking about this. So it&#8217;s like, if this was,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>you gotta go. So this might, you know, maybe we leave this as a thought experiment. Yeah. Um, if that&#8217;s 49</p>\n\n\n\n<p>and then that&#8217;s,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have no idea. Because it&#8217;s like 40 times. I mean, for 150% you get 10, 10 x the value,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>and you&#8217;re making&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:54:46] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> easy, easy math for &#8217;em.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:54:49] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> That&#8217;s kind of what I&#8217;m, yep. So backwards 1 49.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stick. It&#8217;s doing something weird.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So something like that. Yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:55:21] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Let&#8217;s simmer on this. Um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:55:31] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> So yeah, we&#8217;ve got, right now we&#8217;ve at least got benefits and features on the homepage, stubbed out, and then pricing. We can, people watching, listening, please weigh in. We don&#8217;t have the biggest viewership in the world, but anybody who who does have an opinion on this would be great. Um, and it would actually, so maybe we.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, post this in post status business and I might post this also in MegaMaker and just say, what do people think about this? I think it would be neat. Um, we might or might not listen to anybody, but it would be interesting to get people&#8217;s thinking about it. I agree. Um, and, um, Disclaimer, we should have said this before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nobody is allowed to hold us to what they just saw, um, or any of these conversations. Um,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:56:25] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> but okay. Well, today, to summarize what we&#8217;ve talked about, I&#8217;m trying to do this more so it&#8217;s on the recording. Um, we&#8217;ve talked about logo. We worked on website homepage, features and benefits, pricing. Um, and now we got some next steps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What are those?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:56:51] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> So thinking about this stuff, um, tweaking these 10 sites, annual</p>\n\n\n\n<p>100 sites, lifetime. What do you say? One year? One year of support? Yeah. Lifetime updates. Um, okay. So yeah, I think we think about, we think about pricing, um, have some conversations with people about that. Think about the words that we&#8217;ve put on this website, and if there isn&#8217;t a way to. Massage them so that they&#8217;re a bit more coherent, less brain dump.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, you know, and then also I think I may, I may take a pass of, um, we&#8217;ve bookmarked a few sites that we like a design of, so I try to actually bring some design to this so that it&#8217;s not just stripes of color. Sounds good.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:57:54] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Cool. All right, man. Good progress. Thank you. Yeah. Good work today.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:58:01] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Chat soon.

This is the first step towards a more unified experience of editing both content and design. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users can now <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/50565\">create new pages</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/50565\">view page details in the sidebar</a>, an experience that is very similar to editing a page in the block editor except it keeps the process inside the flow of design editing.</p>\n\n\n\nvideo credit: <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/06/14/whats-new-in-gutenberg-16-0-14-june/\">Gutenberg 16.0 release post</a>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This means you can practically build out a website without leaving the Site Editor, which speeds up the site creation process, makes it easier to see what the final result will look like, and reduces the overall cognitive load of switching between editors,&#8221; Automattic-sponsored core contributor Nick Diego said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This update to the Site Editor will be available in the upcoming WordPress 6.3 release, along with the Details block, which has been <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/50997\">stabilized in Gutenberg 16.0</a> and is no longer under the Experimental flag. The implementation was <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/49808\">scaled back to be more simple</a> by including the summary as part of the block itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>The Command Center, created to be an extensible quick search for jumping to other pages or templates inside the editor, has come out of the experimental stage as well in Gutenberg 16.0. This is another major feature coming to core in the next release, and <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/51169\">its API is also now public</a>, opening the possibility for developers to create custom commands.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few other user-facing highlights in this release of the plugin include the following: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Unlinked spacing controls have been <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/50660\">optimized and condensed</a> to take up less space in the settings UI</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Block spacing and layout controls <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/49050\">added to Post Template block</a>, so users can control the space between posts inside the editor</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/50726\">Improvements to List View</a> that make it easier to drag to the top and bottom-most positions</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/51101\">Add <code>delete</code> action</a> for pages in navigation sidebar</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Check out the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/06/14/whats-new-in-gutenberg-16-0-14-june/#dimensions\">release post</a> for more details on all the enhancements, bug fixes, and tooling, accessibility, and performance updates included in Gutenberg 16.0.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 14 Jun 2023 21:56:29 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:\"type\";i:128;s:7:\"headers\";O:48:\"WpOrg\\Requests\\Utility\\CaseInsensitiveDictionary\":1:{s:7:\"\0*\0data\";a:8:{s:6:\"server\";s:5:\"nginx\";s:4:\"date\";s:29:\"Wed, 05 Jul 2023 08:22:02 GMT\";s:12:\"content-type\";s:8:\"text/xml\";s:13:\"last-modified\";s:29:\"Wed, 05 Jul 2023 08:00:30 GMT\";s:4:\"vary\";s:15:\"Accept-Encoding\";s:15:\"x-frame-options\";s:10:\"SAMEORIGIN\";s:16:\"content-encoding\";s:4:\"gzip\";s:4:\"x-nc\";s:9:\"HIT ord 1\";}}s:5:\"build\";s:14:\"20230615065637\";}', 'no');
